            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Chap. 134. Doct.</hi> The way of the Goſpel that brings to Heaven, is an eaſie way. This confirmed and explained in ſix particulars. 637</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 135.</hi> Six Evidences of the former Doctrine in the laſt Chapter. 1. Becauſe the word that injoyns theſe waies is Sweet. 2. A Gracious Soul counts his Duties his priviledges. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He would rather come under any other Burden, than caſt off the Yoke of Chriſt. 4 Becauſe Chriſt whoſe Yoke it is, is Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. 5 Never any that truly put their neck under this Yoke, would willingly take it out again. 6 The Experience of all the Saints of God prove the Point 641</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 136.</hi> The Second Particular mentioned, Is opened in two differences between a Carnal heart, and a Gracious Soul, in the waies of God. 1 The Hypocrite finds eaſe in the waies of God and Sin both. 2 The Hypocrite hath ſome eaſe, becauſe he miſtakes the Yoke of Chriſt, contenting himſelf with
<pb facs="tcp:168534:5"/>the outward forme of Godlineſs, but the beleevers eaſe comes from the power of it. 649</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 137.</hi> Containeth a third and fourth Difference between the eaſe of an Hypocrite, and true Beleever in the waies of God. For, 1. They are eaſie even to the Corruptions of an Hypocrite. 2. He takes up the waies of God partially 658</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 138.</hi> Containeth Six differences more of the former Point. 5 A Carnal heart can take up and lay down duties when he will. 6 He hath eaſe in the remiſſneſs of his Spirit. 7 His eaſe is al alike. 8 The more eaſe he hath, the more ſluggiſh he is. 9 He hath but one principle in the heart that acteth him both in the waies of God, and the waies of the world. 10 His eaſe comes from the performance of duties in his own Strength 663</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 139.</hi> Divers Objections anſwered. The eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the waies of Chriſt; which is the third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mentioned in Chap. 139. 672</item>
               <item>

                  </hi> What the things are that makes the waies of Chriſt eaſie (which is the fourth point in Chap. 139.) opened in five particulars. 1 They are ſuch as a gracious Soul wil impoſe upon himſelf. 2 He comes freely off to them. 3 The waies of Chriſt are even, and not contrary one to another. 4 They bring Strength with them. 5 In them all there is good Succeſs. 6 In them a gracious heart is alwaies receiving his wages. 7 He hath all the paſſages of Gods providence to help him. 8 They bring eaſe to the Conſcience. 9 They free the Soul from cares.
<pb facs="tcp:168534:6"/>10 They make all other things eaſie 703</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 143.</hi> The Yoke of Chriſt eaſier than the Yoke of the Law: For, 1. The Ceremoniall Law required abſtinence from the comforts of the Creature. 2 Its Service was chargeable. 3 The Ceremonies were beggarly Rudiments 719</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 144.</hi> The Yoke of Chriſt eaſier than the Yoke of Sin, and Antichriſt 726</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 145</hi> Eight Conſequences from the former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, 1. The world is miſtaken about the ſervice of Chriſt. 2 A great ſin to reject Chriſt. 3 Bleſs God for this eaſie Yoke. 4. Bring not an evil report upon the waies of Chriſt. 5. Chriſt wil expect much Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it being ſo eaſie. 6. Make not the Yoke of Chriſt hard. 7 We ſhould give up our Selves to Chriſt. 8. It is an accurſed thing to be an Apoſtat 737</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 146.</hi> The means to make the waies of Chriſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to our ſelves. 1 Our obedience muſt be Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. 2 Keep the heart in a readineſs to every duty. 3 Get the heart in love to the duty. 4 Loſe not your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements. 5 Continue not in the guilt of any ſin. 6 Order the duties of your Condition. 7 Leave the Succeſs wholly to God. 8 Bind not your ſelf to what Chriſt doth not. 9 Lay hold upon al opportunities. 10 Preſerve all experiences. 11 Beware of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing paſſions. 12 Entertain communion with the Saints. 13 Exerciſe much faith. 14 Get ſtrength of Grace 750</item>

               <p>WE have Finiſhed that great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Doctrine of <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> we are now to come to the next leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we are to Learn of Chriſt, <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Heart,</hi> and this of a lowly Heart, is of very near affinity unto a meek heart
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:168534:7"/> yea the truth is, a lowly Heart is the Mother of Meekneſs, though Meekneſs is ſet before in my Text, yet in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures, where we have Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Humility joyned together, we have Meekneſs ſet after, and Humility, and Lowlineſs ſet before, as in <hi>Coloſſ. 3. 12. Put on therefore as the Elect of God, Holy and beloved, Bowels of Mercy, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of mind, Meekneſs,</hi> Humbleneſs of mind, Meekneſs, there <hi>Humbleneſs</hi> is ſet before, and that is indeed the true Chriſtian <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> that doth come from <hi>Lowlineſs, Lowly in heart,</hi> The word here <hi>Lowly</hi> (in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) it ſignifies one even lying upon the ground ready to be Trodden on, as ſome Learned obſerve, <hi>Lowly in Heart.</hi> In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 6. There you have this word here Tranſlated <hi>Lowly, Caſt down,</hi> one <hi>Caſt down. Nevertheleſs God that comforteth thoſe that are Caſt down,</hi>

                  </gap> the ſame word that is here Tranſlated in my Text <hi>Lowly,</hi> is there <hi>Caſt down,</hi> ſuch whoſe Heart is <hi>Caſt down.</hi> And in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and the firſt. <hi>Now I</hi> Paul <hi>my ſelf beſeech you, by the meekneſs and gentleneſs of Chriſt, who
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:168534:7"/> in preſence am Baſe among you,</hi> Who am <hi>Lowly</hi> or <hi>Baſe,</hi> ſo you have the ſignification of the word, and what it is, in other Scriptures, <hi>Lowly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Lowly in Heart, Learn of me, for I am Lowly in Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Not in a low condition, I do not require of you that you ſhould be in the low condition of Poverty, and the like, as I am, ſome falſly would imitate Chriſt to be in ſuch a low condition, becauſe that he had poſſeſt nothing in the world, therefore they would not, and ſo ground their ſuperſtitious vows of a voluntary poverty. Indeed, the word Tranſlated, <hi>in Heart,</hi> ſignifies ſomtimes the low condition of a man. As in 1 <hi>James, 9. Let the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Low degree, Rejoyce in that he is Exalted,</hi> That is, in a Low condition. But many men are in a low condition, and yet far from being <hi>Lowly in Heart,</hi> There may be a very low condition, and yet a very high, proud Heart; there may be Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation where there is no Humility, Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Humility are two ſeveral things, a man or Woman may be Humbled, and yet not at all Humble; Many people, that are very low in their condition, Yet, Oh! the pride of their Heart in their low condition, what vexing and fretting of Heart is there againſt the waies of Gods providence towards them, and diſpoſing of them? Now thou art in a low condition, and thy Heart vexing and froward, thy heart is not a whit low by thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Many men that heretofore have been in a high condition, and God hath brought their eſtates lower, but not their hearts a whit, Oh, Happy, happy were it for thoſe Men and Women if he had brought their hearts low; this is the way to make Gods bringing them low in condition to be a great bleſſing to them. You that are marriners, when
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:168534:8"/> you meet with ſtorms and tempeſts, you would think it a very abſurd and fooliſh thing to have your top Gallent, and top ſailes ſpreading to the ful all open in a ſtorme, No, now you narrow your Sailes, and take them all in, and take them down when the ſtorm is up. Now this is a fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of many that God pleaſeth to bring into a low condition, that when God cauſeth ſtorms and tempeſts to be upon a Soul, they keep up their ſailes ſtil, it is juſt indeed that they ſhould be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that will not pul down their Sails when the Lord cauſeth a grievous ſtorm to come upon them, how many that are in very low eſtate, and yet have extreame ſtubborn hearts, and ſtout Spirits, as ſtout and ſtubborn as ever before they were, they have envious Spirits at thoſe that are above them, becauſe others are not as low as themſelves, and have ſullen Spirits, and ſinking Spirits, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spirits in their low condition, all theſe argues a great deal of pride, that though their condition is low, yet their hearts are not low, the Devils themſelves, they are low enough, they are caſt down to Hell it ſelf, and yet the proudeſt creatures that are, none ſo proude as the Devils are, and their pride appears much in their diſcontentedneſs, they are proude and diſcontented, and the moſt diſcontented ſpirit is the proudeſt Spirit; ſo that a man may be of a low condition, and yet not low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Heart, <hi>Learn of me, for I am Lowly in Heart,</hi> it is the <hi>Lowlineſs of Heart</hi> that Chriſt would have us Learn of him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A man may be Lowly in words, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive in words, and yet far from <hi>Lowlineſs in Heart,</hi> in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29. 4. There you may ſee what ſome afflictions may work to make us Lowly in words, in expreſſions, <hi>And thou ſhalt be brought down; and
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:168534:8"/> ſhall ſpeak out of the ground, and thy ſpeech ſhall be low out of the Duſt, and thy voice ſhal be as of one that hath a Familiar Spirit, out of the ground, and thy ſpeech ſhall Whiſper out of the duſt, I will bring thee down ſaith God.</hi> Whereas in the time of mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, they ſpeak ſwelling words, as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> 16. Speaks, <hi>Great words, high Words,</hi> when they are in the ruffe of their pride, and the height of their proſperitty, but you ſhal have many of theſe brave ſpirits, that have ſuch ſwelling words when they are in their jollity and proſperity, yet when God brings them down upon their ſick Beds, Oh, then they Whiſper and ſpeak low, as one out of the duſt, and then Oh! their words are very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive and yeilding, and will hearken to any thing that you ſay, I but yet for al this, their hearts are not brought down, their Hearts remaine as ſtiff as before, which appears by this that aſſoon as ever the hand of God is off from them, they are as ſtout and ſtubborn as ever before. So that there may be Lowlineſs in expreſſions, where there is not Lowlineſs in heart.</p>
               <p>And again, many may be Low in Expreſſions of words in diſcommending themſelves, and yet be proud in heart, either in accuſing themſelves of ſuch things, as they hope others will not beleeve them, or denying ſuch things as they hope others wil contradict them in, you ſhal have many people that wil have a ſeeming kind of humility, and be ready to ſpeak very hard things of themſelves, and ſay, they are very poor weak people, and have but little ſtrength in them, and not fit for ſuch and ſuch imployments, and it is fit that others ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in thoſe imployments rather than themſelves, and they have wretched, and vile hearts, and when they come amongſt others they ſpeak of their vile
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:168534:9"/> wretched heart, and they cannot do thus and thus, and very large they will be in ſpeaking very ill of themſelves, and deny that they have any excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as others have; and yet their hearts extreamly proud, which appears in this, becauſe if any body elſe ſhould be of their mind, they would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſcontented, if any others ſhould ſay, O! God hath given you great Gifts, this pleaſeth them, whereas if others that are in Company and hear them charge themſelves to have ſuch vile and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched hearts, and to ſay, they cannot do thus &amp; thus. Suppoſe they ſhould be of the ſame mind, and they ſhould ſay, I thinke it is ſo, that you are a poor ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Creature, an ignorant Creature, and you have a very hard heart, and a proud and ſtubborn heart, now if any ſhould be of their mind, they would be angry with them and be diſpleaſed. Doth not this argue a great deal of pride of heart? I remember <hi>Bernard</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion in his Books, ſaith he, if another ſhould accuſe me as I accuſe my ſelf, I were not able to bear it, he confeſſed this pride of his heart, though he did accuſe himſelf, yet if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould ſay the ſame thing of him he were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear it, and I am confident it would be fo with abundance of people, when they come in company and ſpeak thus of themſelves, it is but to fetch out commendations from them, that others might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, and they would be mightily diſpleaſed if others ſhould ſay of them that which they ſay of themſelves, in <hi>Prov. 17. 7. Excellent ſpeech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh not a Fool, much leſs do lying lips a Prince.</hi> Now the words that are thus read in your Books, you may in another way read them, they ſeem to carry another expreſſion than is carried here, the word ſignifies <hi>Dignity;</hi> So <hi>Arius Montanus, The lips of Dignity becomes not a Fool,</hi> that is, it is not fit for one that is a Fool to ſpeak of excellent
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:168534:9"/> things, as if he had any excellent things in him, much leſs do lying lips a Prince, it is here, but the word doth not only ſignifie a <hi>Prince,</hi> but an <hi>Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man,</hi> a man that hath an excellency, and worth, ſo you may turn it, as <hi>a Lip of Dignity</hi> becomes not a <hi>Fool,</hi> ſo neither <hi>do lying Lips</hi> become one that hath <hi>an Excellency</hi> in him, one that is of an ingenious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it is not for him to diſſemble, it is a very unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing for one that God hath given an excellency unto to diſſemble. In <hi>Job</hi> 13. 7. It is ſaid there, <hi>What wil you lie for God?</hi> wil you ſpeak that which is falſe even for God himſelf? will you ſpeak wickedly for God, and talk deceitfully for him? We are not to walk deceitfully, no, not for God, not for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, though we ſhould think there might come the greateſt good from it, yet we muſt not do it, and therefore certainly not for our own praiſe, to fiſh out praiſe for our ſelves, this is to be lowly in words, but not in heart.</p>
               <p>Somtimes we do not only diſcommend our ſelves in a feigned manner to others, but even to God alſo. How do we in prayer tel God how wretched &amp; vile we are? and deſerve to be caſt into the nether moſt Hell, and what a wonderfull mercy it is, that we have the leaſt crumb of bread, and unworthy of the leaſt crumb of bread and drop of water, thus we ſpeak very lowly before God; and yet in the mean time have very proud, and ſtubborn hearts, this is not to be lowly in heart. Learn of me, not lowly words, not lowly ſpeeches ſo much, but learn of me to be lowly in heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: There may be a lowly carriage where there is not a lowly heart, many that have very proud and haughty ſpirits, yet will in their carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſeem to be very affable, and courteous, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſweet, and very ſubmiſſive, and very yeilding:
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:168534:10"/> ſo that thoſe that are of weak ſpirits, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, Oh, ſurely this man is a very humble man, he muſt needs be a very lowly man, mighty lowly, how ſweet, and affable, and courteous, and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive is his carriage? It is true, for to have lowlineſs in words and carriage is good, and where there is a lowly heart, there will be theſe in ſome meaſure or other, but yet theſe may be much without a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart, there may ſeem to be an excellency in theſe, and yet no lowlineſs in heart: there may be a complementing to the ground, a man may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to put his hands upon your feet, and yet have a very haughty ſpirit. I will give you theſe Srip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for it. In 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. It is the example there of <hi>Abſolom, Abſolom</hi> we know, was a moſt deſperate proud ſpirited man, and he aſpired to the Kingdom, and was ſo ſet upon pride, that he did plot the very death of his own Father, of <hi>David,</hi> that he might get up to the Kingdom, and yet mark this <hi>Abſolom</hi> at verſe 5. <hi>And it was ſo,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>that when any man came nigh to him, to do him obeiſance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kiſſed him,</hi> any man, the meaneſt man that came nigh to him to do him obeyſance, he would put forth his hand, and take him, and kiſs him, ſo at verſe 6. <hi>So Abſolom ſtole away the hearts of the men of</hi> Iſrael. A man by his deceitfulneſs this way, may ſteal away the hearts of ſimple people. Certainly, the men of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> thought <hi>Abſolom</hi> a very humble and lowly man, and thought: O! might we but have this man <hi>Abſolom</hi> to be our King, how happy ſhould we be? and yet at this very time, the very heart of a Devill in him for pride. And another Scripture is that in <hi>Pſalm. 10. 10. He croucheth, and humbleth himſelf, that the poor may fall by his ſtrong ones.</hi> Who is that <hi>He?</hi> mark, it is the ſame that is ſpake of in verſe 2. <hi>The wicked in his pride perſecutes the poor.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:168534:10"/> at verſe 4. <hi>The wicked through the pride of his countenance will not ſeek after God.</hi> And ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> at ver. 10. <hi>He croucheth and humbleth himſelf.</hi> He wil ſeek for his own Glory, and that his own ends may be brought about, he will crouch ſo low as you will have him, ſubmit to any thing though never ſo baſe and vile, rhat he may accompliſh his own ends. And therefore all thoſe that will ſubmit to very low things, you muſt not think preſently they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heart, a man may ſeem to be very lowly in words, and ſubmit to very low things for his own ends, but then he will be proud enough when once he hath got into the ſaddle, he will rule you then, he will tell you, he will do any thing in the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rld you would have him to do, till once he gets power over you, and then is the time for the manifeſtation of the pride of his heart. But there may be lowly carriage, and not lowlineſs in heart.</p>
               <p>Now thoſe that carry themſelves courteouſſy and lowly in carriage, and yet have proud hearts, you may judg of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt: Their lowly carriage is to them that are at ſome diſtance from them, ſuch as they have n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t very much to do withall, you ſhall have many, that when they come abroad, and come into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with ſuch as they have not very much to deal withall, they will be very lowly in their carriage to them, but may be in their Family they will be dogged enough, perverſe enough, haughty enough, ſullen and ſurly enough, though very courteous and yeildable to any thing, and very ſweet unto others that are at a diſtance from them.</p>
               <p>Secondly: They are lowly to Servants, or to thoſe that have not had any occaſion to croſs them, Oh! how ſweet is their carriage there, to people that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver croſt them: But now come to any that croſs
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:168534:11"/> them, you ſhall find them as haughty, ſurly, and proud towards them, as any man whatſoever, if once they be croſt, try but ſuch as ſeem to be many times ſo ſweet in their carriage to you. I do not mean to croſs them wilfully, but obſerve them when they are croſt, and ſee what a difference there is between the affableneſs and ſweetneſs of carriage that is in them when all things pleaſe them, and when they come to be croſſed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: Their carriage is to thoſe that they may accompliſh their own ends by ſomthing or other that they would accompliſh, but if they have to deal with ſuch as no way can further any ends of theirs, they ſhall have no ſuch carriage from them, this is but to ſhew the diſtemper of the heart, there may be lowlineſs in carriage and not in heart: But do not think that I ſeem in the leaſt manner to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend lowlineſs in carriage, it is comely in Chriſtians to be gentle one towards another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: There may be lowlineſs in habit, and yet not in heart, ſome will pleaſe themſelves in this, in going very meanly clad, and in all their outward Garb are very mean, and they think they will not be ſo proud as others are, ſo high and brave as others. It is true, there is a great deal of pride to be ſeen in outward habits, but alſo there may be a great deal of pride ſeen in lowlineſs of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, as well as in brave habits. As there is a great deal of pride in following every vain faſhion, ſo certainly there may be much pride in a ſullen reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that they will never wear any thing but thus and thus, in a fantaſtical ſingularity from other kind of people of their own rank, though never ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they will have a ſingular Garb of their own; this is out of fullenneſs, as no queſtion there is in many a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now there may be in the fullenneſs of others an extream vanity of ſpirit and pride, and many of theſe think to honor Chriſtianity, whereas they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hſhonor it hereby, if thou beeſt ſo weak as thou doſt not know what liberty thou haſt in the uſe of the Creature; Wilt thou judg others that do know? You muſt take heed of Pride, and ſingularity in thoſe things which you think to deny your ſelves. It was a ſpeech that <hi>Socrates</hi> had concerning <hi>Antiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſee the arrogancy of</hi> Antiſthenes <hi>through the holes of his Coat,</hi> he would go ragged, and with holes in his Coat, but ſaith he, <hi>I ſee the very arrogancy and pride of</hi> Antiſthenes <hi>through the holes of his Coat.</hi> And ſo when <hi>Diogenes</hi> came to <hi>Plato</hi> and he had a rich Bed, and <hi>Diogenes</hi> in his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickneſs and pride, tramples upon <hi>Platoes</hi> rich Bed, ſaying, <hi>I tread and trample upon the pride of</hi> Plato, I ſaith <hi>Plato, but it is with thy pride,</hi> it is pride that tramples upon this pride, it was the pride of his heart that did ſo diſdain that another ſhould have that he had not himſelf. There may be much vanity, and pride, and height of ſpirit, in lowlineſs of Garb and outward habit. But yet ſtil we ſhall come further to open the nature of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the evil of pride that is contrary to it, and we ſhall come to diſcover the pride in Habits, and ſpeech, and the like, but only now to make way to what we ſhall come to, now to get in a little into the point that we may not miſtake what Chriſt would have us learn of him, when he ſaith, he would have us learn to be lowly in heart.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: There may be a kind of lowlineſs of
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:168534:12"/> ſpirit which Chriſt diſavows, and which Chriſt would not have us learn of him, not only a lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of words &amp; habit, but a lowlineſs of heart, that they muſt take heed of a baſe fordid ſpirit, that is as uncomely for a Chriſtian as any thing in the world. A Chriſtian, though he muſt have the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the heart of Chriſt, yet there is the lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a baſe fordid ſpirit that is infinitly unbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the excellency of a Chriſtian. What is that baſe droſſy, low ſpirit of many people?</p>
               <p>Firſt thus: It is a baſe fordid ſpirit to imploy themſelves in things beneath their Condition in which God hath ſet them: As for inſtance, ſuppoſe a Magiſtrate, or a Miniſter, ſhould fill a Dung-cart, and he ſhould plead thus, it is true, others are ſo proud they will not do it, but I am content to do the meaneſt thing, Is this a lowly heart? No, it is a baſe fordid heart, for men that are of any quality to mingle themſelves with poor mean things, to be in the Ditches, in places that are beneath them, to imploy themſelves in things that are beneath the condition that God hath ſet them in, this is not Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility but fordid and baſe ſpiritedneſs.</p>
               <p>And then, when men likewiſe, ſhall ſeek low and mean things, and bleſs themſelves in things that are very low, and mean, and allow themſelves in them, as if ſo be they were enough to make them happy, when they ſhall <hi>feed upon others,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks of that <hi>Idolatry:</hi> And ſo wicked men when they ſhall <hi>feed upon aſhes,</hi> this is a baſe thing, for a man to have his belly cleave to the earth, to ſeek to ſcrape for a little of the world, and bleſs himſelf in this, and think himſelf a happy man if he can get a little money, and if he have a little applauſe in the world, this is that he placeth his happineſs in, and ſeeks after no higher good,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:168534:12"/> and this he would be content ſhould be his portion, if he can get a little money together, and have Houſe and Lands; this is a low ſpirit, for one that profeſſeth himſelf a Child of God, for him to ſeek after the things of the world, and ſatisfie himſelfe in them, it is as if a Prince ſhould leave the Throne of his Father, and go and ſcrape in the Kennels, Wil you ſay, it is the Humility of a Prince? Were it the Humility of a Prince, to leave the Court, and all the Glory there, and thoſe excellent imployments about State affairs, and ſcrape in the Kennels? Were this the lowlineſs of a Prince? No, it were a baſe ſpirit. As I have heard of ſome great Heirs, when they have been yong, and ſtolen by Beggars, afterwards when they have been taken away from Beggars and put into good Cloaths, yet they have got ſuch a baſe ſpirit, that they would leave off all to put on Rags again, and go a begging. Thus the greateſt men, that ſeem to be lofty in their aims and deſigns, they have low ſpirits, for they do but ſcrape Kennels in this world, and with the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall feed upon Husks and Swil: whereas the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, though they are to be lowly in heart, yet do aim at high things, to ſeek after eternity of Glory, to ſeek after a Crown, after Heaven, to ſeek after God himſelf, to live for ever with God in Glory, and though they are to acknowledg them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy of the leaſt crumb of Bread, yet they are not to be ſatisfied with all the world for their portion, they are to have ſuch high Spirits, as not to ſatisfie themſelves with all the world for their portion. You will ſay, here is a high Spirit indeed, thus it is, nothing will ſatisfie him except he have the infinite God to be his portion. Your proud men, that are eſteemed to be the higheſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, they will be ſatisfied with a little Muck in the world, but the Child of God hath ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:168534:13"/> Spirit; that if God ſhould offer him the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Heaven and Earth for his portion, he wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d count a little pittance, and he would ſay, Lord, there are higher things that I look for to be my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and God is very well pleaſed that his people ſhould have ſuch high Spirits in that ſence, to ſeek after a Kingdome, to ſeek after Glory, and to think themſelves too good for a Luſt, for ſin to rule over them to think themſelves in a higher Condition, than that theſe poor, mean things ſhould be enough to be their portion, and their happineſs.</p>
               <p>Thus I have only ſhewed you the Negative, what it is that Chriſt doth not mean, when he ſaith, Learn of me, for I am Meek, and lowly in heart, he means none of theſe five things.</p>

               <p>The firſt is this, That diſpoſition of ſpirit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one that is in a high, and excellent condition, yet is content to become low for God, and for the good of his Brethren; though he be in an excellent eſtate,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:168534:13"/> yet is content to be in a Lovv condition, ſo it be for God, and the good of others; and this is that Lovvlineſs that belongs only to Chriſt himſelf, he vvas thus Lovvly. And alſo God the Father is lovvly, that God is of a Lovvly Spirit, thus to be content to be lovv for his ovvn Glory, and for the good of others. Ye have it in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 113. 5. and 6. <hi>Who is like unto thee, Lord our God, who dwelleth on high, who humbleth himſelf to behold the things that are in Heaven, and in the Earth, God is on high and yet God humbleth himſelf to behold, to have regard to things that are in Heaven and Earth.</hi> Obſerve the Phraſe, I beſeech you, it is Gods humbling himſelf, if it be but <hi>to behold the things that are in Heaven,</hi> God is ſo high, that if he doth but vouchſafe to look upon the things in Heaven, he doth humble himſelf, he b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ings himſelf Lovv to behold them, much more upon the <hi>things in Earth,</hi> Oh! Hovv doth God humble himſelf then to regard the things on Earth as he hath done. And ſo Chriſt, that vvas from all eternity infinitly bleſſed, vvith the Father, yet for the Salvation of mankind, vvas vvilling to bring himſelf into a Lovv condition, and ſo Lovvlineſs belongs to the Father, and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But the lowlines that is moſt proper unto us, that we may yet learn of Chriſt, that we may gather from Chriſts Example arguments to further it in our own hearts, I would deſcribe it thus. <hi>It is that grace, whereby the Soul doth behave it ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards it ſelfe, and towards others, according, or anſwerable unto that right eſteem and ſence that he hath of his own vileneſs, and meanneſs.</hi> Formally this was not in Chriſt, but only thus far, Chriſt being once willing to take upon him that low condition, of being a Mediator for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:168534:14"/> ſo there was a meanneſs that was in Jeſus Chriſt, and Chriſts demeanour of himſelfe, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwerably unto God, and to others, ſuitable unto that mean condition that he knew himſelf was in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through his willingneſs to be a Mediator for mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that was Chriſts lowlineſs, though Chriſt as the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, cannot have the Rule of his Low lineſs to be the eſteem of his own meanneſs, and ſo of God; and therefore I gave you ſuch a deſcription of Lowlineſs, that may belong to the Father and the Son; but now this only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Chriſt as Mediator, and that Lowlineſs that ſhould be in our hearts, that vve may gather abundance of Arguments from Chriſts low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to further it in our own Soul. The meaſure of our humility, it doth conſiſt in the right eſteem of our own meanneſs, when a man or Woman hath a right eſteem, that is, come to know themſelves in that mean condition that they are in, and to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of that mean condition that they are in, and accordingly come to behave themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards themſelves, and towards others; theſe are ſuch as indeed have lowly hearts. Now in this deſcription that I have made of Lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or of humility, you wil find (when we come to open it, and to ſhew the workings of an humble heart that ought to be in Chriſtians) there will be very much diſcovered that nearly concerns us, but all that I ſhal do now is, to ſhew how Jeſus Chriſt was lowly in heart himſelf. And then what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments may be drawn from the Lowlineſs of Chriſt, for the furtherance of Lowlineſs in our hearts. There is one thing in the Point that I am ſpared from ſpeaking off, to handle this Lowlineſs of Chirſt, as Chriſt is a Teacher, that we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Learn of me, for I am Meek and Lowly,</hi> That is,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:168534:14"/> be willing to Learn of me, for I am a Meek Teacher, and a Lowly Teacher, and therefore be willing to be my Schollers, Now that I have already ſpoke of, when I ſpake of being taught by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhewed you what a fit Teacher he was, and I think this hath reference unto him, that he is not ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but he will Teach the meaneſt; and ſuite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all, but now we are to ſpeak of what Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs was in Chriſt, and how we ſhould Learn to be Lowly as he was.</p>
               <p>Now for the Lowlineſs of Chriſt, that you have in divers Scriptures, in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 22. is a Prophetical Scripture concerning Chriſt, and mark what is ſaid of Chriſt there, verſe, 6. <hi>But I am a Worm, and no man, a Reproach of Men, and deſpiſed of the people. But I am a Worm,</hi> They are even the ſpeeches of Chriſt concerning himſelf, it is apparent it is a prophetical <hi>Pſalme,</hi> concerning Chriſt, In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Pſalme</hi> you have the very ſame words that Chriſt ſpake upon the Croſs, <hi>My God, My God why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> And here I am <hi>a Worm, and no Man,</hi> Oh! How Lowly was Chriſt, that was God bleſſed for ever, it were lowly enough, one would think, to be a <hi>Man,</hi> but to be <hi>a Worm, and no Man</hi> in his own apprehenſion, Oh, what Lowlineſs was this? And then in <hi>Iſai,</hi> 53. 2. There you may ſee the Lowlineſs of Chriſt, that likewiſe is prophetical concerning Chriſt, that he ſhould <hi>grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a Root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no Beauty that we ſhould deſire him, he is deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our Faces from hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 chunk">

<pb n="494" facs="tcp:168534:15"/> doth this argue the Lowlineſs of his Heart? For you told us even now, that a man may be in a low condition that is not Lowly in Heart. For An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Chriſt was not compelled to it, but freely took upon him to be in this condition, for the Glory of his Father, and the good of Poor S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uls, ſurely, it is a lowly heart that was willing to be put into ſuch a condition as this was.</p>
               <p>But above all Scriptures, that is remarkable to this purpoſe, in <hi>Phillip. 2. 5. Let this mind be in you, which alſo was in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> What mind was that? There is not only the condition of Chriſt, but the mind of Chriſt, a lowly Heart, and let that Lowly heart be in you, What was that? verſe, 6. <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no Reputation:</hi> He made himſelf, he did e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now to ſtand upon things largely, to open the Lovvlineſs of Chriſt, that vvil not be needful, but to ſpeak generally of it, for that is neceſſary, forvve cannot bring it home vvith povver to our Point, if we do not open it in general, for it vvould ask many exerciſes to open the Lovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Heart that vvas in Jeſus Chriſt. You knovv in opening his Meekneſs vve ſhevved you, vvhat Meekneſs vvas in him, And novv for Lovvli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. As thus,</p>
               <pb n="495" facs="tcp:168534:15"/>
               <p>Firſt, There was Lowlineſs in him to undertake to be Mediator between God, and mankind, it was a great Lowening of himſelf, as we may ſpeak after the manner of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If he would undertake to be Mediator, then God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>els him he muſt become a man, and take Human Nature upon him, and that in a perſonal union, that Chriſt the infinite glorious Son of God, ſhould be content to be made a Man, that it ſhould be ſaid of him, this perſon is a man, this is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lowening of himſelf. In <hi>Hebrews, 2. 16. He did not take the Nature of Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But the Nature of Man, <hi>The Seed of</hi> Abraham It had not been ſo much Lowening of himſelf, if he had taken upon him the <hi>Nature of Angels,</hi> No ſaith God, if you wil be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for man, you muſt take the <hi>Nature of Man,</hi> This Poor Wretched Creature; ſaith Chriſt, I will do it rather then man ſhould Periſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When he takes the Nature of Man, one would think he would be Born of the greateſt Queen upon the Earth, if Chriſt muſt come, and take the Nature of man, and be Born in the Womb, it would be of the greateſt Empreſs, No, of a poor Woman, a Poor Virgin, a Poor Maid, and therefore ſhe ſaith, in <hi>Luke. 1. 48. For he hath regarded the Low Eſtate of his Hand-Maiden,</hi> It is not there <hi>Lowlineſs,</hi> as noting Humility, but the <hi>Low condition of his Hand-Maid,</hi> The Lord regarded the <hi>Lew condition of his Hand-Maid.</hi> Of purpoſe, to that end, to incourage thoſe that are in a Low condition, that Chriſt ſhould paſs by al the Princeſſes, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſſes in the World, and be willing to be born of a poor Maid, for ſhe was not a Rich Maid, nor had great things, that appears by the offering that ſhe made for Her Purification, in <hi>Luke,</hi> 2. 22. and
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:168534:16"/> the 24. verſes. <hi>When the daies of her Purification, according to the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>were accompliſhed they brought him to Jeruſalem to preſent him to the Lord, and to offer a Sacrifice according to that which is ſaid in the Law of the Lord, a pair of Turtle Doves or two young Pidgeons.</hi> Her Sacrifice was a pair of Turtle Doves, or two young Pidgeons, but mark, it is ſaid according to the Law of the Lord, do but compare this Text, with the Law of God that required an Offering of every Male that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Womb, in <hi>Levit. 12. 6. When the daies of Her purifying are fulfilled, for a Son or for a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe ſhall bring a Lamb of the firſt year for a Burnt offering, and a young Pidgeon or a Turtle Dove for a ſin offering unto the Door of the Tabernacle of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, ſhe ſhall bring a Lamb,</hi> here is no Lamb brought, for ſo indeed, the Law did ſo far indulge, that if they were poor, the Lamb might be ſpared, as in another Law, ſo that in this her offering, that ſhe did not bring the Lamb, the Lamb that the Law did appoint, it was meerly from the indulgence of her Poverty, becauſe ſhe was a poor Maid, Noting, that if there be a poverty, and we do what we can, the Lord will not ſtand ſo much for great offerings, when we do what we are able, ſo the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe had not Money to buy a <hi>Lamb,</hi> but ſhe brings <hi>a pair of Turtle Doves, or two Pidgeons,</hi> And this is that which is accepted. And then his Low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not only in being born of her, but in being born in one of the meaneſt Villages, and places, not in the Metropolis <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but in BETHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEM. And then it was in an <hi>Inn,</hi> you know he had no ſtately Houſe, or Country Houſe, or brave place for to be in, but it was in an <hi>Inn,</hi> and it was in her Journy. Great Women, when they are with Child, will not be travelling in Journies, but will take ſtate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:168534:16"/> while, but ſhe was in her Journey, I, and when ſhe was in an <hi>Inn,</hi> ſhe could have never a Room, Surely ſhe muſt be in a Low condition. If a begger Woman ſhould be ready to cry out, if there were a poor Room that had but a Chimney in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would grant it to her, but ſhe was in a ſtable to be brought to Bed in a ſtable, your Vagrants and Rogues that go up and down cannot be worſe then this, and ſhe had no proviſion it ſeems, but was fain to lay her Child in the Manger; this infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, and Lord of Heaven and Earth, behold him lie in a Stable and a Manger. And beſides he was willing to be in this condition, he choſe this condition, ſurely he had a Lowly Heart.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: And further Obſerve, It may be ſaid, but if he doth come as a man, and come into the world in a Low condition yet he may be ſome body in time, Nay, but he muſt be a Servant in the world he might have had poſſeſſion of the world, and might have had the honor to have been a King, but he muſt live as <hi>a Servant.</hi> So the Scripture ſaith, in <hi>Philip. 2. In the Form of a Servant.</hi> Nay, he was not only in the <hi>Form of a Servant,</hi> but in the <hi>Form</hi> of an evil <hi>Servant,</hi> a Servant to be beaten, that is a Low condition to be in the ſtate of a Servant, but to be in the ſtate of an Evil Servant, to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that is a Low condition indeed, ſo was Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: Yea, not only to be a Servant that was beaten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to be made a curſe, ſo in <hi>Galath.</hi> 3. 13. not only <hi>Curſed,</hi> but a <hi>Curſe,</hi> in the abſtract. Yea, more then this, not only to be a Servant, and to be beaten, and made a curſe, but to be made <hi>Sin,</hi> that that is lower, So in 2 <hi>Corinth. 5. 2. He that knew no Sin, was made Sin for us:</hi> we wil not ſtand to open theſe Particulars, only ſo far is expreſſed the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:168534:17"/> Low condition that Chriſt was in, how Lowly in Heart Chriſt was. And all the way as we go, you cannot but ſee, that there will be a great many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to work Lowlineſs of Heart in al that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt. After he came into the World, and was put into ſuch a condition, he was fain to flie for his Life, to flie into <hi>Egypt</hi> to ſave his Life, and being delivered, then he lives Thirty years in a Low, Poor, Mean condition. He is reputed Low in his parentage, his Father a Poor Carpenter, and his Mother a poor Woman, not able to live in the world, and yet he lives Thirty years together in ſubjection to this poor Father and Mother, to live in obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ence to them, and ſeeks to live upon his Trade, to live as a Carpenter, Hewing of Timber, for this is the Reaſon they cal him the Carpenters Son, he lived not Idly. And when he came to be manifeſted the Redeemer of the World, even then the Devil himſelf had ſome power over him, he was in ſome kind under him as you may Read in <hi>Matth. 4. He was carried by the Devil, and Set upon the Pinacle of the Temple.</hi> It is a great matter for the Devil to carry any of our Bodies up and down, for Chriſt to be carried by the Devil, this was very Low. And when he enters upon his office, he wanted bread Fourty daies together, thus he was brought low &amp; al this was free. And then in the conſtant way of his Poverty, you know what he ſaid of himſelf. <hi>Matth. 8. 20. The Foxes have Holes, and the Birds of the Air have Neſts, but the Son of man hath not wherein to put his Head,</hi> Chriſt had not ſo much as Birds, and Foxes, No little Cottage. Many of you think it hard that you are fain to live in a poor Smoakey hole, a poor Cottage; you have more then Chriſt had, Chriſt had not ſo much as a Gave to hide his Head, though he was poſſeſſer of all the world, he was brought in ſuch a Low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:168534:17"/> and all for thee, and to teach thee. And when he came to chooſe his Diſciples, See the lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ſpirit there, he did not chooſe the great ones, Emperors, and Kings, and high ones of the world, but choſe a company of illiterate men, Publicans and ſinners, Illiterate and deſpiſed men Chriſt choſe, and Galileans, yea, Men of <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> the worſt place in all the Country, <hi>Can any good come out of</hi> Galilee? And for the other Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that ſhould follow. Who were they? When Chriſt came to his own they rejected him: For a man to be rejected when he ſhall come out of another Countrey, and come home: Suppoſe one of you ſhould have a Friend come out of another Countrey, and when he comes home, all h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Not the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, not the great ones, not the learned ones of the world, <hi>But this Multitude,</hi> a curſed Generation, a company of poor Wretches, a company of Women that were with Chriſt, and poor Creatures that did follow him; How loathſome were they in the Eies of all thoſe that did behold Chriſt. And when he wrought Miracles, there was not many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that he wrought at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but his Miracles was for the moſt part wrought in obſcure Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. When he was transfigured in his Glory, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny muſt not ſee him, he carries only thoſe to ſee him in his Glory that muſt ſuffer for him, thoſe that ſaw him in his Agony, and he charges them not to tell any man at all, which ſhews the lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Spirit: And not only ſo but he goes yet further, and he humbles himſelf as the Scripture ſaith, to Death, a painfull Curſed Death, as
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:168534:18"/> he did upon the Croſs, to be firſt deſpiſed, ſpit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They ſpate upon his face before, and ſcorned him, and put Thorns upon his Head, and Buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him. Yea, his own Diſciples forſake him in his ſufferings. And then he muſt die among Theevs, and a Murderer muſt be choſe, before he muſt be choſe, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And then he was put into the Grave, and there his Humility was ſeen: and then what his Spirit felt then, was more than all. Certainly, when he cryed, <hi>If it be poſſible let this Cup paſs,</hi> and <hi>My God My God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Oh! the Spirit of Chriſt was in a low condition at that time: Now that Chriſt ſhould be content to put himſelf into this condition, Surely, the heart of Chriſt was very low. Not to ſpeak of the lowly carriage of Chriſt in his life, and his tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe he met withall, that we ſhewed in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Meekneſs of Chriſt, but all this you have in the Story of his life.</p>
               <p>Sixthly: But further conſider what kind of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs it was, to omit the conſideration of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who he was, that was hinted in ſpeaking of his Lowlineſs, for that is indeed the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all to ſet forth the Lowlineſs of Chriſt that ſuch a Perſon, that is the <hi>Brightneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Character and ingraven Image of his Perſon</hi> to be in ſuch a low condition, it is ten thouſand times more, then if all the Kings, Princes, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors in the world, ſhould have been Dogs and
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:168534:18"/> Toads, they ſhould not have been ſo much hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as Chriſt was humbled, in being made man for mans ſin. But now beſides the Perſon, Conſider further this, That his Lowlineſs in all his carriage was not only towards his Father, but towards men, when he was a man, yet he carries himſelf as if he were under man; there is many my Brethren will carry themſelves lowly unto God, and when they come into Gods preſence they will have low thoughts, but towards man they cannot, Chriſt was lowly towards men: You may obſerve in the ſpirits of men, many will be very crouching and ſubmiſſive to thoſe that are above them, but unto thoſe that are under them, of the moſt domineering ſpirits that are. I have obſerved of others, that when they are to deal with thoſe that are Noble men, and above them, they will crouch, and be very ſubmiſſive and hukmble towards them, but when they come to thoſe that are under them, thoſe that are poor Servants, or Children, they will be as Tyrannicall as can be. But Now Chriſt was low towards man, as well as towards God, low to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Inferiors, as well as towards his Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. And that is obſervable: Chriſt was low when he was to have Honor and Glory; as when you know they would have come and by force have made him a King, they would have compelled Chriſt at one time to be a King, and laid hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but he would by no means regard it, and he continues in this lowlineſs: And ſo the Devill ſhewed him all the Glory in the world, and ſaith, <hi>All this will I give thee,</hi> but it was nothing to him. And there was another time that is very obſervable for the lowlineſs of Chriſt Perſon, as obſervable as any time, that in <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 8, 9, 10. It was the time when Chriſt was brought to <hi>Herod,</hi> the Text ſaith, <hi>When</hi> Herod <hi>ſaw Jeſus, he was exceeding glad, for
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:168534:19"/> he was deſtrous to ſee him of a long ſeaſon, becauſe he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to have ſeen ſome Miracles done by him. Herod</hi> had a very high eſteem of Jeſus Chriſt, he had heard great fame of Jeſus Chriſt, that he had wrought many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and when he came to him, he made account ſurely, I ſhall ſee ſome great Miracles done by him, and therefore <hi>Herod</hi> is preparing to Honor Chriſt, but Mark: becauſe <hi>Herod</hi> was a vile, and a baſe man, he would not anſwer him a word, at verſe 9. <hi>Then he queſtioned with him in many words, but he anſwered him nothing, And the chief Prieſts, and Scribes ſtood, and vehemently accuſed him, and</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod <hi>with his men of war ſet him at naught and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous Robe, and ſent him again to</hi> Pilate. As if <hi>Herod</hi> ſhould ſay, What a poor ſilly man do you bring before me, I had thought you would have brought me a man that would have wrought Miracles, but I ſee he is a poor ſilly Fellow? Now Chriſt he was tempted to have ſought Glory at <hi>Herods</hi> Court, and of men, Chriſt might have ſhewed himſelf to have had that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in him, that <hi>Herod</hi> ſhould have had more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to him than to the Scribes and Phariſees, but Chriſt would not do this, but ſuffered himſelf to be accounted a poor, ſleight, mean, Perſon, and to be ſcoffed and mocked at, and puts up all.</p>
               <p>But further, That that I would obſerve for the lowlineſs of Chriſts Spirit, it was when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Proud Ones, many men will ſeem lowly when they are among Chriſtians that are lowly: When they are amongſt a company of Chriſtians that are broken in heart, their hearts wil be broken too, and vvhen a company of Chriſtians are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning their condition, and lamenting their ſtate; they vvil do ſo too, this is nothing, but to be of a
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:168534:19"/> lovvly, ſelf denying, yeilding Spirit, vvhen a man is among proud ones, when a man converſeth with thoſe that are proud in the world, than ſtill to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt lowlineſs, this is to be like Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Yea, and further, that is another circumſtance that is very obſervable, to be lowly and humble when our lowlineſs and humility ſhall be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is an ordinary thing for Men and Women to manifeſt humility, vvhen their Humility ſhal bring credit to them, for there is a great deal of humility that brings credit to them, and they knovv it well enough, and therefore they will ſeem to be humble when they are among them that will honor them, and prize them the more for that humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but if they be in a place, where the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they appear, the more they ſhal be ſcorned, and they ſhall not be honoured for their humility, not eſteemed the better for it, this is the tryall of thy Grace, and of others Grace, to manifeſt Grace in ſuch a place, and among ſuch company that no body wil take notice of it, ſo as to prize it, and prize you for it; but on the contrary wil contemn you, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn you for it, you ſhal be ſcorned the more becauſ you are humble, yet than to be humble at that time, &amp; in that Company, Here is the Glory of a Chriſtian indeed: In theſe three or four things eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts Humility, To be humble towards our Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and when you are tempted to the contrary, many are humble many times when they have no temptation, but ſet a Beggar a Horſe back, if he have any temptation, and then they will not be humble, Chriſt had the greateſt temptation and yet was humble. And then to be in company where they will ſcorn you, and contemn you for your Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and yet to be Humble conſiſts in this Humility. And al this in the conſtant courſe of your Life, to
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:168534:20"/> be humble at a fit, and a ſtart, there is but few men and Women in the world, but take them in ſome fit or ſtart, and they will be humble, but at other fits they will be proud; but Chriſt had a conſtant Lowlineſs of Spirit, what ever the variety of his condition was that he was put into, yet ſtil his Heart was low, if the people did cry <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to him, yet he carried himſelf with a Lowly Spirit: ſo for a man or Woman to have ſuch a ſtrength of Spirit, that though they be put into varieties of conditions, ſomtimes one way, and ſomtimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, yet to keep a conſtant Lowlineſs of heart in all conditions, this is to Learn of Chriſt, and this is but to ſet forth the Lowlineſs of Chriſts Spirit, <hi>Learn of me, for I am Meek and Lowly,</hi> Well, may Chriſt ſay of himſelf, that he was Lowly in Heart.</p>
               <p>Yea and to add this one more.</p>
               <p>He was lowly for others, Chriſt was lowly for the good of others, we may be lowly and crouch perhaps for ſome deſign of our own: but Chriſts Lowlineſs, His Emptying of himſelf was for the advantage of others, and therefore, as for himſelf in <hi>John</hi> 17. the beginning, ſaith Chriſt there unto his father in his praier, <hi>Father Glorifie me with the Glory that I had with thee before the beginning of the world.</hi> It ſeems Chriſt is content with the ſame Glory he had before the vvorld vvas, What ſhould become of all that Glory that he had purchaſed by his lovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, It is as if Chriſt ſhould ſay? Let my people have all that, vvhatever Glory is purchaſed by my lovvlineſs, by my humbling of my ſelf I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they ſhould have that Glory, but as for me, Father, The hour is come, Glorifie thy Son, I have Glorified thee on Earth, O Father Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me vvith thine ovvn ſelf, vvith the Glory
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:168534:20"/> I had with thee before the world was, I will be content with the ſame Glory I had from thee before the world was, Surely there ſhould be a great deal of Glory purchaſed by his Humility, yet ſaith he, Let me but have that, and as for the other Let my people have that, thus Chriſt is lowly, for us, to teach us to be lowly, and deny our ſelves for others as well as for our ſelves. But of this more when vve come to ſhevv hovv vve ſhould be lowly as Chriſt was in the opening of our Lovvli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                  <p>Six Arguments from the Lowlineſs of Chriſt to work Lowlineſs of ſpirit in our hearts. 1. It was one ſpeciall end of his coming into the world. 2.

It is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly pleaſing to God. 6. It may ſtand with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great things.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt novv to ſhevv vvhat Arguments might be dravvn from the lovvlineſs of Chriſts Spirit ſo as to work Lowlines in our hearts. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath a Speech concerning the Lowlineſs of Chriſt, ſaith he, <hi>Are ye aſhamed to imitate an humble Man? Imitate then an humble God,</hi> Imitate God that was content to be Humble: but take theſe three or four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt: Conſider in this, As if Chriſt ſhould call upon you, Learn of me for I am Lowly, I am ſent by God the Father into the world, this is one ſpeciall
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:168534:21"/> end that I am ſent into the world for, to hold forth unto all the world a pattern of humility, there were theſe two things that were the errand of Chriſt: Firſt he was ſent into the world to be made a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice; And then to be made a Pattern of Holineſs, and eſpecially of this Grace of Holin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſs, namely of Humility, I am appointed as a great Ordinance of God the Father to hold forth this: God the Father doth ſhew three things in Chriſt ſo demonſtratively, as we cannot conceive that an infinite Wiſdom was able to deviſe a way to ſhew them forth more than in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Vileneſs of Mans ſin, and the deſert of it, is ſuch an Argument, that we would not Imagine an infinite Wiſdome could deviſe more, as if God ſhould ſay, I have ſuch an Argument to ſhew the vileneſs of mans ſin, and the deſert of it, as infinite Wiſdome could not deviſe a geater.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And then the Second thing God would ſhew that he would manifeſt infinite Wiſdom, he would ſhew his love to mankind; ſaith God, I have ſuch an Argument of my love to mankind, that infinite Wiſdom could not deviſe a greater, and that is, ſending of Chriſt into the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the Third Argument of humility and ſelf denial, God would have the Children of men to have low hearts before him, this was the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Gods ſending Chriſt into the world, Well, ſaith God, I give many precepts in my word for men to deny themſelves, and if they look into themſelves, the low condition they are in, they may have many Arguments to be low, I but, I have an Argument beyond all Arguments in the world, and that is, I ſend my Son into the world, and he
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:168534:21"/> ſhall manifeſt ſuch Lowlineſs in his carriage and Converſation, that it will be the greateſt Argument in all the world that an infinite Wiſdom could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe. Now hath he ſent us ſuch a pattern, then he teacheth us to follow, and to be ſure to Learn of him that was of ſuch a lowly heart, to Learn of him, ſo as to be lowly in Heart as he was.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond thing is, That this pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of humility it makes pride in man a deſperate evil, it aggravates the pride of man, with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation ſhal God look upon a wretched worm, that ſhall be proud when his own Son was ſo Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? <hi>Bernard</hi> in a Sermon of his upon the Nativity of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>What more unworthy? What more deſpicable? What more vile to be puniſhed then this? That thou ſeeſt even the God of Heaven to be made a little one, made Low, yet thou being a man, Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieſt thy ſelf, when God is made Low, it is moſt into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable impudency,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Whereas he emptyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when Majeſty indeed hath emptied himſelf,</hi> That is his word, that a worm ſhould ſwel, vvhen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath emptied himſelf, what intolerable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency is this? Oh! it vvil be that which will cauſe God to come in a horrible rage, when he ſhal ſay, What? Shal my Son thus deny himſelf, and be thus Low? A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d what! Shalt thou be proud? What! Shall be willing that my Son ſhould be Low, and deny himſelf, and ſhalt not thou a Worm deny thy ſelf? Nothing argues more the Lowlineſs of Chriſt, then this emptying of himſelf and denying of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider this, In the Example of Chriſts Lowlineſs, vve may ſee Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the greateſt humility, and the higheſt Excellency may be both together in one: Humility may ſtand vvith the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:168534:22"/> Nobleneſs of Spirit it that poſſibly can be. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men and Women, they vvould not be Lovvly and Humble, becauſe they think it vvould note too mean and too abject a Spirit, they think it an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing to have a brave Spirit, a Noble Heroical Spirit, but to deny themſelves and to be Lovvly, they think it is to have too Mean a Spirit, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand vvith excellency and nobility, but novv vve ſee by the Example of Chriſt, that the higheſt excellency, and the greateſt humility may ſtand both together, for never vvas there ſuch a Noble, Heroical Spirit as Chriſt had, and yet never ſuch a Lovvly Spirit, the truth is, a proud Spirit is a baſe and mean Spirit, but an humble Spirit is a raiſed Spirit, as we ſhal hear afterwards, only now we ſee in Chriſts Example, that nobleneſs, and braveneſs of ſpirit, and yet lowlineſs of heart may ſtand together, I confeſs this is one of the greateſt Miſteries of Godlineſs, and yet thoſe that are taught in the Miſteries of Godlineſs do underſtand this.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, And Further, in this Example of lowlineſs there is this more: for in this we may ſee that lowlineſs and Wiſdom, yea the very height of Wiſdom may ſtand together: many are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deny themſelves to be of lowly Hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think it is Folly, it is Fooliſhneſs for them to deny themſelves: but in Chriſt we may ſee, that the higheſt Wiſdom, and the loweſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in denying our ſelves may ſtand together, Chriſt the Wiſdom of the Father, and yet he is of a lowly Spirit, indeed, pride is the greateſt folly, as will appear afterwards.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And further, Another force of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Chriſts Example to Teach us lowlineſs is this, we may in Chriſts Example ſee, what it is
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:168534:22"/> that is infinitly pleaſing unto God the Father, Chriſt did pleaſe his Father infinitly, in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt was moſt eminent, in that he did moſt eminently pleaſe the Father. Now of any vertue that the Scripture notes, Chriſt was moſt eminent in the vertue of humility, that is a principal one, and therefore it muſt needs be, that in that Jeſus Chriſt did eminently pleaſe the Father. Now, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, <hi>Learn of me, for I am Meek and Lowly.</hi> Would you know what it is that would pleaſe my Father moſt, that would make you moſt acceptable unto my Father? Look upon my Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I pleaſe my Father my Father delights in me, he profeſſeth that in me his ſoul is well pleaſed, Now I know what would pleaſe him, namely, for me to be willing to deny my ſelf ſo far for his Glory, and for the good of others, for me to be willing to be in ſuch a low condition, as I was willing to be in, I know that this would Pleaſe him, now look upon my Example, if you would know what would pleaſe my Father, follow me in my ſteps, be you Lowly in heart.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Another is this, here we may ſee in this Example, that great things may be done where there is a Lowly heart, that lowlineſs of heart, and doing very great thing may ſtand together. Many men think that if they ſhould be of lowly Spirits, they ſhould not be able to do great things in the world, and therefore they think they muſt have their hearts up, and their ſpirits up: Now God did greater things, being humbled, then ever he did before he was humbled, to ſpeak after the manner of men. Gods infinite po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer did not do ſuch great things before, as in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbled, for the work that Chriſt did in his humility, by being humbled for mans ſin, it was a
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:168534:23"/> greater work then the creation of the world; now his Exaltation is made but a fruit of his humiliat on, God by his infinite power creati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rm, and no man, as the Scripture ſpeaks, therefore the greateſt thing that ever was done by God himſelf, it was by being brought into a low condition, Now therefore, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>neſs of ſpirit, and doing great things may ſtand together, Yea, We ſhall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> further clear it to you, that no man is ſo fit to be regarded in great ſervices, as that man that hath the moſt lowly ſpirit, and God doth not delight to uſe any man in great works ſo much as that man that is of a lovvly ſpirit. Wel therefore, Chriſts Example is to be ſet before us; to be lowly as he was Lowly. And further, there is this alſo in Chriſts Example to work lowlineſs in us, Chriſt was lowly for us, and therefore why ſhould not we be lowly for him? I was lowly for you, and therefore why will not you be lowly for me? There is a great deal more Reaſon that you ſhould be Lowly for me, then that I ſhould be lowly for you. And if we conſider the difference between Chriſts lowlineſs, wherein he was lowly for us, and what he requires of us to be lowly for him; we ſhall ſee the Reaſon very ſtrong, As now, Chriſt was made lower for us, then he doth require of us to be made for him. As for inſtance, Chriſt was made ſin for us, God doth not require that we ſhould be made ſin for him. It is lower for Chriſt to be made ſin for us, Then for us to endure all the afflictions in the world for him. The utmoſt that God requires of us in our lowlineſs is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we ſhould be willing to bear afflictions, and troubles, and deny our ſelves in our comforts, and the like; but to be made ſin, God never put his creature to this, to be in ſuch a low condition for him, that

               <p>Again God doth not require that of us that he did of him, that is, that we ſhould be willing to bear the wrath of God, that we ſhould be willing that the Lord ſhould forſake us, and we ſhould ſtand under his wrath: but this vvas required of Chriſt, and Chriſt vvas vvilling for our ſakes to be put into this lovv condition, but the Lord never required this at our Hands, to be put into ſuch a lovv condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this is.</p>
               <p>Yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Further, Chriſt had God the Father vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dravving himſelf from him, and forſaking of him, vvhen he vvas lovv, and vvhen God puts us into a lovv condition vve have uſually the preſence of God more comfortably, and more glorious vvith us then ever, and vve may expect it, at that time, vvhen vve are put into the lovveſt condition for God, that vve ſhould have the moſt glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God vvith us, and God vvould incourage us to be lovvly upon that ground, becauſe the ſpirit of God, and Glory ſhould then reſt moſt upon us. But novv Chriſt, he knevv that vvhen he ſhould be put into the loweſt condition, that then God the Father would withdraw himſelf from him, that then he ſhould have leaſt of his preſence, that then God would Leave him in that low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we are not put upon this: Yea, the leaſt
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:168534:24"/> thing that Chriſt ſuffered was a thouſand thouſand times more then the greateſt thing that we can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, yet Chriſt was called to be in a lower conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (and was willing to be ſo) then ever God cals us to be, now is there not a great ſtrength in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument? If it were only thus, if Chriſt ſhould ſay, there is Reaſon you ſhould be as I was, low as I was low, As we read of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> when ſhe was coming unto <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſhe ſees him walking in the Field, and asked the Servant who it was, and he ſaid it was his Maſters Son, preſently <hi>Rebecca</hi> lighted down, and goes on her Feet, ſhe would be as he was, he walked, and <hi>Rebecca</hi> lights off her beaſt that ſhe Rode upon. And there is a great deal of Reaſon the Spouſe of Chriſt ſhould be low as Chriſt is, if Chriſt ſhould but ſay, I am lowly thus and thus, be you content to be as I was, I but Chriſt never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that, I was low indeed, and I expect that you ſhould be low, as I was, but not ſo low, I will never put you to be made ſo low as I was, be but content to be low as I was, in ſome little thing, but for the great things wherein I was made low, I will never put you to this, now there is a great ſtrength of Argument in this, when as Chriſt propounds to us his Example, that in that Example he doth not require we ſhould be ſo lovv as he vvas.</p>

We uſe to ſay of a man, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uch a one hath excellent parts, and he knovvs it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but the knovvledg of our ſelves that vvay may puffe up, but this knovvledg of our ſelves, to knovv our ovvn meanneſs and vileneſs, and vvret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſs, this is that that humbles us; and ſo an humble Heart makes that to be the rule of his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:168534:25"/> according to vvhat he ſhal have made knovvn to him of his ovvn meanneſs, and vileneſs. This knovvledg of our ſelves is that that the Heathen did commend, to knovv <hi>thy ſelf,</hi> it vvas <hi>a great Maxime</hi> of theirs, a great point of Wiſdom for them to knovv themſelves, but certainly, they meant eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their ovvn excellencies, but a Chriſtian that knovvs himſelf, it is eſpecially to knovv thine ovvn vileneſs, and thine ovvn vvretchedneſs, and becauſe humility doth order the heart according to this knovvledg, therefore the Scripture ſpeaks of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of mind, in <hi>Colloſ. 3. 12. To be low in our mind,</hi> Firſt the mind muſt be lovv before the Heart be lovv, in the judging of our ſelves, vve muſt judg of our ſelves right before the heart can lie lovv, vve muſt judg of our ſelves by the right rule, by no falſe rule, but by examining of our ſelves according unto the vvord, according to vvhat the vvord of God doth reveal concerning us after Serious, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſtrict examination of our ſelves, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovvs the vvork of Humiliation a right judging of our ſelves firſt. A Heathen Phyloſopher being ask'd What is the hardeſt thing in the World? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvers. <hi>Noſcere teipſum;</hi> to knovv thy ſelf, the braveſt thing in the World for a man to knovv him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and indeed vve that profeſs our ſelves to be Chriſtians, vve may find it by experience to be ſo, the hardeſt thing in the World to know our ſelves, <hi>The heart of man is deceitfull above all things, and who can know it?</hi> The heart of man is, <hi>Grande profundum,</hi> a very great depth, there's not one of ten thouſand that knovvs himſelf, there is a great Art, and Skil in being able to know ones ſelf, and that is the reaſon that there is ſo little Humility in the World becauſe we do not knovv our ſelves, every proud man is a Fool, a Fool in this, Becauſe he knovvs not himſelf, he doth not give a right judgment of himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:168534:25"/>
               <p>Now for the way of knowing our ſelves, and what the word of God doth help us to know our ſelves in, that we ſhal not ſpeak of in this place, but only to ſhew the ground of Humility, it is the knowledg of our own vileneſs, and the judging of our ſelves, according to what we know of our ſelves, not according to what others think of us. A humble man doth not much go according to what any body elſe knows of him, or eſteems of him, but according to what he knows and eſteems of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It was a Speech of another Heathen, <hi>Do not beleeve others of thy ſelf, more than thy ſelf of thy ſelf,</hi> It is a Fooliſh thing for any man to go by the eſteem that others have of him, and not by the eſteem that he hath of himſelf upon right examination, it may be other men may in Charity judg that thou haſt this, and this, ſuch and ſuch Graces, and ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, while in the mean time thou mai'ſt know thy ſelf to be a vile, mean, wretched, baſe Creature; Novv a proud heart will rather go according to what others think of him, than indeed according to what he knovvs of himſelf, it may be other men that live vvith thee, that ſee but the outſide, they give a good report of thee: But vvhat report doth thy ovvn Conſcience give of thee? What doſt thou knovv of thy ſelf? That thou ſhould'ſt look moſt after. While our friends do rejoyce in thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies they eſteem us to have, in the mean time thou mai'ſt ſee the cauſe to be confounded in thine ovvn thoughts, and to be aſhamed before the Lord, and to have ſuch thoughts of thy ſelf, that if the Lord ſhould diſcover unto thy friends, that now eſteem highly of thee, what thou knoweſt of thy ſelf, thou would'ſt think that they would kick and ſpurn thee out of their Company, and be ready to ſpit in thy face. I make no queſtion but thoſe that look into their own hearts, and obſerve the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of their own ſpirit, thoſe that know what is
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:168534:26"/> within, and are acquainted with themſelves, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times when others have high eſteems of them, they ſee cauſe to look upon themſelves with ſuch ſhame, as to beleeve that if others ſhould but ſee the inſide, if God ſhould turn their inſides outward, all their friends that have ſuch eſteems of them now, would be ready to abhor them, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to loath them, if they did but know what they are of themſelves. And indeed it is a great Argument for to make thoſe that have any acquaintance with their own hearts to be humble, to ſuffer any outward meanneſs, to be willing to ſuffer any thing that might make them low outwardly, Why? Becauſe of the great mercy of God to conceal from men what evill is in them. Thou art loth to ſuffer ſome outward affliction, but if God ſhould diſcover to all the world all that evill that is in thee, and that thou art conſcious to thy ſelf of: Yea, take the beſt Man and Woman that is, if all the evill that they themſelves are conſcious to themſelves of, were diſcovered, it would make them more vile than any mean condition that ever God put them into, Yea, than any outward affliction can poſſibly put them into. God rather doth eſteem of us, &amp; wil rather judg us according to what we eſteem of our ſelves, than according to what others think of us; And therefore in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. that place that is well known, <hi>If our Conſciences condemn us, God is greater than our Conſciences, and knoweth all things.</hi> It is no matter what others ſay, others may juſtifie us, others may think we have excellent Gifts, and exccellent Graces, and we perform duties in an excellent manner, but in the mean time our own Conſciences may condemn us. Now the behavior of a proud heart, is rather according at what others think of him, then what he thinks of himſelf, though he knows never ſuch vileneſs in his own
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:168534:26"/> heart, as now in Duty, he joyns with us in Prayer, perhaps he hath excellent expreſſions in Duty, in Prayer, that the hearts of thoſe that are with him, are taken with him, and bleſs God for the Gift of God in him, and what Graces he exerciſeth in Prayer, and ſo others are bleſſing God for him and highly eſteeming of him, and themſelves happy that they joyn with him, now upon that he hath a proud heart, and bleſſeth himſelf in that and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in that, while in the mean time his Conſcience tels him, that he hath a baſe heart, a proud ſpirit, an empty heart, and a dead heart, and that all this while there hath been a mighty unſutableneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his heart, and the expreſſions: Now if his heart be humble, he will not look what others ſpeak of him in this kind, but be aſhamed and confounded in his ovvn ſpirit, becauſe of vvhat he knovvs of himſelf, Certainly vve may ſee ſome ground vvhy others ſhould think vvell of us, and ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We read of the ſpirit of Man in <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 27. it is ſaid of the ſpirit of Man, <hi>That it is the Candle of the Lord, ſearching all the the inward parts of the Belly.</hi> Now you know that by a Candle, if you bring a Candle into a Room, you may ſearch in corners, ſecret corners, under every bench hole, and ſee fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>NOw theſe two being laid as the ground of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> the proportion upon which an humble Soul goes.

You will ſay, it is a behavior anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this: It is Firſt, in reſpect of God: Secondly, It ſelf: Thirdly, Others.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhould ſhew you what is in an humble Heart in this reſpect, and then come to ſhew the great excellencies of a Lowly Heart.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In regard of God, as God hath a ſpecial Eye to a Lovvly Heart, ſo a Lovvly Heart hath a
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:168534:29"/> ſpecial Eye to God, there is no object that God Eyes more then an humble heart, and there is no object that an humble heart Eyes more then God.</p>
               <p>Now the behavior of an humble heart towards God is eſpecially in theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Humble Heart doth acknowledg the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtance that there is between God and it ſelf, and from this infinite diſtance that he ſees between God and himſelf he comes to be more, and more vile, no man or woman in the world is humble, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they have a knowledg of God, they cannot be vile in their own Eyes in a Chriſtian way, except God hath made himſelf known to them, but when the Lord doth acquaint the Soul with himſelf, and the Soul comes to ſee and acknowledg the infinite diſtance between God and it, and upon that comes to have high thoughts of God, and low thoughts of it ſelf, this is the firſt work of an humble Spirit in reſpect of God. You know that in <hi>Job, 42. 4, 5. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now mine Eye ſeeth thee, therefore do I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Here was <hi>Jobs</hi> Humility, Oh, Lord, I have a ſight of thee, I ſee an infinite diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and me, and it is this that makes me have ſuch high thoughts of thee, and low thoughts of my ſelf, and therefore <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes:</hi> It may be, many of you, when you are put into an affliction, perhaps God takes away your eſtate that makes you dejected, God laies an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon your body, your Wife, or Husband, and that dejects you, Oh, but the right dejection of the Spirit is this, I ſee an infinite diſtance between God and me, and that is it that lowens my ſpirit more then any thing in the world. I appeal unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath God beaten this upon your ſpirits, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit diſtance between God and you, and upon that
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:168534:29"/> you have layen low. There is a notable Scripture in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. and the beginning, <hi>The words of</hi> Agur <hi>the Son of</hi> Jakeh, <hi>even the Prophecy, the man ſpake unto</hi> Ithiell, <hi>even unto</hi> Ithiell, <hi>and</hi> Ucal, <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh then any man, and have not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of a man, he ſpake to</hi> Ithiell <hi>even unto</hi> Ithiell, <hi>and</hi> Ucal. Now there is a great variety of interpretations of this place, but I find the moſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it, <hi>Ithiel,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>cal,</hi> being two Names of Chriſt that <hi>Agur</hi> makes uſe of, and ſo he ſpeaks unto Chriſt as God, for ſo <hi>Ithiel</hi> is, <hi>God with me,</hi> and it is ſuitable to that name of Chriſt that you have in the firſt of <hi>Matthew,</hi> the 23. Chriſt is there called <hi>Emmanuel, God with us,</hi> and here his name is <hi>Ithiel, God with me,</hi> that is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between thoſe two Names of Chriſt, <hi>Ithiel</hi> and <hi>Emmanuel, Immanuel</hi> is to ſignifie Chriſt being God and Man in generall for the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>God with us,</hi> but <hi>Ithiel,</hi> is that name of Chriſt whereby a Beleever applies Chriſt to himſelf parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, not only is the Savior of the Elect, the Savior of all Beleevers, is God with all Beleevers, but <hi>Ithiel,</hi> he is God with me, my Soul, I apply him particularly to my own Soul, he is God with me, I look upon Chriſt as God to all Beleevers, and to all Beleevers for their good, but looking upon Chriſt as applying him to my own Soul, So I look upon Chriſt as <hi>Ithiel, God with me,</hi> and therefore he repeats this twice, <hi>The man ſpake unto</hi> Ithiel, <hi>even unto</hi> Ithiel, Oh! he loves to look upon Jeſus Chriſt as God with him, particularly with him.

                  </gap>gh the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his own meanneſs. So <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:168534:30"/> ſpeaks to God, <hi>Gen. 16. 27, 28. Duſt and aſhes hath begun to ſpeak to thee, O Lord:</hi> This is the Reaſon of the reverentiall behavior of the Saints of God in the preſence of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the fear of God: Whereas a proud heart is bold before the Lord, and preſumptuous before the Lord, and ſtands it out againſt God, ſtands ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> againſt what is manifeſted in the Word, that might make him tremble, but the leaſt word makes the humble heart to tremble. As we go along we may examin our Humility, whether your behavior be the behavior of an humble heart before God? Do you find this? That as heretofore your hearts were bold in the preſence of God, you could walk in a daring way before God, now you can tremble at Gods word, tremble in his pereſence in a reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall way?</p>
               <p>Thirdly: An humble heart in the preſence of God, hath a relenting ſpirit, humility of ſpirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts it ſelf in walking towards God in this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that it relents and melts in Gods preſence at any manifeſtation of Gods diſpleaſure againſt him. And this is likewiſe cleer in Scripture, that Famous Example of <hi>Joſiab</hi> in 2 <hi>Kings 22. 19. Becauſe thine heart was tender,</hi> or becauſe it did <hi>Melt,</hi> for ſo ſome Books hath it, <hi>And thou dideſt humble thy ſelf before the Lord,</hi> Mark how theſe two are put together, <hi>a melting heart,</hi> and an <hi>humble heart,</hi> whereas if <hi>Joſiah</hi> had had a proud heart, he would have contemned the reading of thoſe papers that was brought unto him, as his Son afterwards did, he took a Pen-knife, cut them, &amp; threw them into the fire, the Son of this <hi>Joſiah,</hi> but <hi>Joſiah</hi> being a man of a very lowly heart, though a King, upon reading of the Law of God that was found in a corner of the Temple, his heart did tremble preſently. And hence in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. thoſe two are put together, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:168534:31"/> in ſpirit, and bleſſed are thoſe that mourn,</hi> ſo that one that is of a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>low ſpirit,</hi> I mean, low in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious manner, not in a baſe way, is one that mourns, is not of a hard heart. It is ſaid of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> that he did harden his heart in pride, Pride had hardened his heart in <hi>Dan. 5. 20. But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride &amp;c.</hi> Certainly, a hard heart is a proud heart: So far as a heart is hard, it is proud, and it is proud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and that is the worſt pride in the world, for a Creature to be proud in its behavior before God.

One ſaid to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> one that was a Schollar, and had great skil in Arts and Sciences, a great Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, he had this Blaſphemous ſpeech; That if he had been at the making of the world, he would have diſpoſed of things better then they are now, any one would ſhake at ſuch a Speech, ſuch a thought as this; but yet in a diſcontented Spirit

               <p n="6">6. The behavior of an humble Soul is in this, and this mainly, That it is willing that God ſhould be advanced in all, and that in his own way, and the latter branch hath moſt dependance upon this, it is willing that God ſhould be advanced above all, and in his own way.</p>
               <p>Firſt, an humble Spirit is willing that God ſhould be advanced, and above all, it is willing that God ſhould be advanced as the higheſt of all, the firſt cauſe of all, I look upon my ſelf as nothing, but look upon God as the firſt cauſe of all; and therefore I being nothing, and having nothing, and am worthy of nothing, it is fit that God ſhould have all Glory, though I have no ſhare; many would be content that God ſhould have Glory, ſo they might have ſome ſhare, I but an humble heart is content that God ſhould have all Glory alone, being willing to lift up Gods Name, and advance him above all. Here is the right temper of an humble heart: <hi>Let him increaſe, though I decreaſe,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 27. he rejoyced that he ſhould increaſe, though himſelf decreaſed, ſo ſaith an humble heart, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Now a proud heart would not only have the comfort and bleſſing, but the Glory too, an humble heart ſaith thus, Oh, it
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:168534:33"/> is mercy that God will imploy me in any thing, it is a wonder that God will uſe me in his ſervice, when he hath uſed me, there is infinite cauſe that what is done he ſhould have the Glory of all after it is once done: So if I be made a Veſſel of mercy that I may retain that, if I am not made a Veſſel of Glory to retain that; indeed, we are Veſſels of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that we may keep them: but we are Veſſels of Gods Glory that may run through us, and we ſhould ſatisfie our ſelves thus, that we may be Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Gods mercy to keep them in us, and to be Veſſels of Gods Glory to have that run through us. <hi>Not unto us, not unto us,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 1. and leaſt it ſhould ariſe, <hi>not unto us, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, not unto us,</hi> the third time, <hi>but unto thy Name be praiſe,</hi> reflects all upon the Lord.

As I remember the ſame learned man, ſpeaking of applauſe, ſaith he, it is like unto the Wind, now if a man turn his back to the Wind, it will help him to go his Journey, but if he go againſt the Wind it will hinder him: So in applauſe, if he turn his back it will help him in his Journey, but if he think to

The example of <hi>Joab</hi> is very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to this purpoſe, in 2 <hi>Sam. 12. 18.

Now if <hi>Joab</hi> ſhall do this for his Maſter, how much more ſhould we do for God? when God ſets us about a work, let us be ſuſpicious leaſt God ſhould not have the Glory, we ſhould lift up Gods Name; as one that lifts up another upon the wall, he that is lifted up ſees, but the other ſees not, ſo we ſhould lift up God ſo as God ſhould be alone ſeen, though we be hidden our ſelves, and if at any time there ſhould any pride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe to take part of the Glory from him, (for we wil be ready to be fingring and filching of the glory of God from him) then humility takes an
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:168534:34"/> advantage by pride, as ſomtimes pride will take the riſe from humility, a man may be proud of his own humility, ſo humility will take the riſe from pride, a gracious heart wil be humble for his pride, and for this we have a notable example too, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 25. It is the Example of <hi>Hezekiah, But</hi> Hezekiah <hi>rendred not according to the benefit done unto him, for his heart was lifted up.</hi> verſe, 26. <hi>Notwithſtanding</hi> Hezekiah <hi>humbled himſelf for the pride of his Heart,</hi> If at any time an humble graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Heart, whom God is pleaſed to imploy in any great Service, ſhal find his heart riſing up, to be filching any of Gods glory from him, preſently it beates down it ſelf ſo much the lower, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will more humble him then to conſider the vileneſs of his heart that would r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I but this is not al, to be humble to have the Lord advanced, every one wil ſay ſo, but this makes the behavior of an humble heart indeed, to be willing that God ſhould be advanced his own way, for God to chuſe his own way to be advanced, this goes hard, we would fain have God advanced in our liberty, in our comfort, and our bleſſings. But what if God wil have al our comforts? Wil have himſelf advanced by our eſtates, and by our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? What if God wil have al our comforts and al we have to be but as a footſtool to get up unto his glory. And indeed an humble ſpirit, appears not only in this, becauſe he ſubmits to what is Gods due, but if the Lord at any time croſs him in any thing, yet an humble heart will think al his croſſes is made up in this that God may have any glory by it, here is the genuine humble Spirit, there is ſuch and ſuch a thing that I am croſſed in, that I have a mind unto, yet it yields to this now, that though I am croſt yet God hath Glory, and I can ſee this
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:168534:35"/> that God hath glory in my affliction. Now when I can account that my afflicton is made up, if any glory can come to God hereby, here is the true Genuine and humble ſpirit, when a man is called to any hard Service, it may be he finds the Service harder then he thought of, I but ſaith he, God is glorified in this Service, and whatever hardſhip I endure it matters not, I account al is made up in Gods glory, and now God is glorified by me in this way, let God be advanced his own way. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you think if you ſhould be put into ſuch and ſuch a condition, God may have more glory, if you had more in largement, and more comfort, but what if God will chuſe to glorifie himſelf in your afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, your low condition? An humble heart wil be content that God ſhould advance himſelf in his own own way.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another form of an humble ſpirit is this, that it admires <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t the leaſt mercy that it is ſo much, and wonders at the greateſt affliction that it is no more, I wil give you one Scripture for it, becauſe it hath reference to what I named Laſt and this both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and it is a notable Scripture to ſhew the form of an humble Spirit, it is that of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 7. in this Chapter God promiſeth mercy to <hi>David,</hi> and the firſt that I wil obſerve is, that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the former, of advancing of God in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have, if you read this Chapter you ſhal find, how God promiſeth that he ſhould be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and his name and houſe Magnified, but now we find <hi>David,</hi> he is more affected with Gods name being magnified than his own, as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, I bleſs thee for what thou haſt done for me, but this is that that rejoyceth me more that thy name is magnified. Now is it thus with thee? Art thou ſollicitous that Gods name ſhould be
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:168534:35"/> Magnified, then rejoyceſt that thy Name is magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? I put this to thee, when God beſtows great things upon thee art thou Sollicitous that Gods name ſhould be glorified rather then thine own.</p>
               <p>And then for the other, he admires Gods mercies, that we have likewiſe in <hi>David,</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18, 19. When the Lord tels him what great things he would do. <hi>Then went</hi> David <hi>in and ſate before the Lord, and ſaid, who am I, O! Lord God, and what is my Houſe that thou haſt brought me hitherto? And this was yet a ſmal thing in thy ſight. O Lord God, but thou haſt ſpoken alſo of thy Servants Houſe for a great while to come, and is this the manner of man O Lord God. What am I?</hi> I bring this Scripture to this end, to ſhew, that the mercies of God will humble an humble Heart, the more God beſtowes any mercy upon an humble heart, the more low wil it grow, in admiring that God ſhould deal thus and thus with it. Whereas a proud heart, when God beſtows mercies, preſently his heart ſwels, but novv if the higher that God raiſeth you in your eſtates or othervviſe, the lovver you are, here is true humility. <hi>Let the Brother of high degree be ſo much the lower in Heart,</hi> Becauſe his degree is made higher, So it vvas vvith <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Who am I? That thou ſhouldeſt do theſe things.</hi> And ſo <hi>Jacob,</hi> you have him admiring Gods mercy to him in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 32. 9, 10. There you have the good man, vvhen the Lord had manifeſted his goodneſs to him in his journey, <hi>I am not worthy, ſaith he, of the leaſt of all thy mercies, and of all the truth that thou haſt ſhewed unto thy Servant, for with my ſtaffe, I paſſed over this Jordan, and now I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come two bands, I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies that thou haſt ſhewed to thy Servant,</hi> He ſtands admiring at the mercies of God tovvards
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:168534:36"/> him, and doth look upon himſelf as vile, becauſe Gods mercies were ſo great. There is nothing more proper to Chriſtian humility then this, therefore to look upon our ſelves as vile, becauſe God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes great mercies upon us. Many men, they ſeem to be low in time of affliction, O then they are humble and low, but when God raiſth them in proſperity then their hearts are high, now a Chriſtian in affliction he is low too, but in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he is more humble, humility takes as much advantage upon Gods mercies to be humble as in affliction, and when it is thus with you, then you have Chriſtian humility in your hearts. Humility doth not ſay of any mercy as <hi>Hieram</hi> of the Cities that <hi>Solomon</hi> gave him, what are theſe my Brother? But what am I that I ſhould have ſuch a mercy? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny becauſe they have not what they would have, they reject what they have, as thus, becauſe they have not ful aſſurance of ſaving grace, though God be putting them into the way that he uſeth to lead them that he purpoſeth to ſave, this is nothing, all is nothing, Now thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Lord, Who am I, that I ſhould have the leaſt mercy from thee? This is the work of an humble ſpirit. And if any affliction befal thee, to be ſo far from thinking thy affliction great, to ſay, never any had ſuch afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as I, Oh that is from the pride of thy heart, it is becauſe of thy pride that the affliction is ſo great, were thy heart humbled the affliction would not ſeem ſo great, but the mercy of God would ſeem great unto thee. As now put a ball into a great Veſſel and it ſeems to be nothing, but put it into a little veſſel and it wil ſeem greater, ſo when the heart is little by humility, then Gods mercy ſeems great, and the truth is the leſſe the heart is, the mercy of God will ſeem the greater, and the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſeem the leſſer, it is becauſe we are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:168534:36"/> of our own vilenſs, and wretchedneſs, and of what our condition might be, that our afflictions are ſo great in our eyes as they are. That is the next thing of an humble Spirit, that it admires at the leaſt mercy that it is ſo much, and wonders at the greateſt affliction that it is no more, <hi>I am leſs then the leaſt of all thy mercies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. An humble ſpirit it is willing that God ſhould put him into mean imployment, and into hard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and into imployment that it can ſee no Reaſon for but only the wil of God, Yea, if the Lord ſhould put him into the loweſt work that ever creature was put into, an humble ſpirit ſubmits and thinks, it is well if I may be in any ſervice at al, <hi>Let me be but as the hired Servant,</hi> ſaith an humble Spirit, As it was with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> they were content that they might be but as <hi>Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water,</hi> So they might but live. The very <hi>Angels</hi> ſhew themſelves humble in this kind, to be willing to be <hi>Miniſtring Spirits,</hi> to the pooreſt Saint in the world, the pooreſt Saint in the world hath a guard of Angels about him night and day, this ſhews the Lowlineſs of <hi>Angels,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould be willing to be ſerviceable from their example in the loweſt work for God, and not think that my parts and my Spirit is fit to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in higher waies, As a Servant to think, why am not I a Govenor? I but to think that it is the condition God hath put me into, this is his Duty. And ſo for Services hard to Fleſh and Blood, Yet an humble Spirit will go on, and the truth is, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in the behavior of the Spirit towards God appears in this, to be content to obey God in what I ſee no Reaſon for in the world, I know it is the mind of God, and though I can ſee no Reaſon for it, yet I will be content to do it, here is ſubjection

An Humble Spirit and one Lowly in heart, is willing to wait upon God his own time, and in whatever way or means God ſhall pleaſe to work in; it is fit that I ſhould wait upon God for any thing I have who am ſo unworthy of any mercy, and the Lord being ſo high above me, between whom and my ſelf there is ſuch an infinite diſtance in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 8. ſaith the Church there humbling it ſelf before the Lord, they do manifeſt their Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thus, <hi>Yea, in the way of thy judgments O!

So in <hi>Lament. 3. 26.

               <p n="10">10. The behavior of an humble heart in reſpect of God is this, That it is reſolved to do what it can to honor God whatever God doth with it, though God deſtroy me, and that everlaſtingly yet I deſire
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:168534:37"/> to keep this reſolution in my heart, I will do what I can to Honor Him. Many that are afflicted and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Conſcience, they have ſome kind of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation wrought, but their Spirits have ſome kind of bitterneſs and ſowrneſs againſt God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they think ſomtimes God will caſt them off, therefore they are ready to caſt off Duty too, now that is an evident ſign the heart is not throughly humbled, ſo far as thou findeſt thy heart work thus: when thou art afraid that God wil caſt thee off; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou thinkeſt that it is beſt for thee to caſt off Duty, and to do no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here is an Argument that thy heart is not humbled.

Thou muſt wait though thou art not ſure; it is thy Duty to wait though God do not for the preſent aſſure thee of Mercy. Indeed, if God were ſo much bound to thee as thou art bound to him, then thou mighteſt ſtand upon thy tearms: But know that thou art infinitly bound to God, and God is not at all bound to thee, and therefore if thy heart be brought humble before the Lord, thou wilt reſolve whatever God doth with thee, yet thou

And theſe are the principal things of the behavior of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart towards God, and indeed the ſpecial work of Humility, it is the work of the heart towards God, which people little look upon: People look upon pride in reſpect of others habit, in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards others, in their vanity of Cloaths, and outward demeanors, but the main work of Pride is in the behavior of the heart towards God, and then we Sanctifie the name of God, when we Sanctifie our hearts in an humble manner, and the Reaſon why the hearts of ſinners are not lowly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, it is becauſe they know not this God, they know not that infinite diſtance that there is between the Lord and their Souls, and here is the Reaſon why the Spirit of bondage lies ſo long many times upon ſinners, Why the Lord doth ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie their Conſciences; It is, that he might bring their hearts to be low before him, that there might be the right behavior of a lowly Spirit before God himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Twelve Properties of a Lowly heart in reſpect of it ſelf. 1. It is very ſuſpicious of it ſelf. 2. It is willing to know the worſt of it ſelf. 3.

               </argument>
               <p>BUt now the ſecond thing that hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded is, The behavior of a Lowly &amp; Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, in reſpect of it ſelf, and there are many things in this, and they are of very great uſe for us, for the ordering of our converſations before the Lord, and the ordering of the behavior of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in reſpect of our ſelves. As,</p>
               <p n="1">1. An Humble heart is very ſuſpicious of it ſelf, I ſpeak of that Humility that may concern our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition here, it is afraid leſt there ſhould be ſome ſecret evill in it ſelf that yet it doth not know, it is very fearful of the deceitfulneſs of its own heart, though it doth not know for the preſent much evil by it ſelf, yet ſtil fears there is much lies hid that is not yet diſcovered: It is a good thing for us to be jealous of our ſelves, knowing how deceitful our hearts are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the proud heart is ready to run away vvith all, is content, and thinks it ſelf better than it is, vvhereas the humble heart fears the worſt of it ſelf, if it ſees an evil in another Man or Woman, it begins to reflect upon it ſelf, and is not this my
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:168534:39"/> heart too? I am afraid that this evill is in my heart. It is reported of <hi>Plato,</hi> that vvhen he ſaw other men doing evil, he vvould ſay to himſelf, <hi>Nonne ego talis? And am not I ſuch a one?</hi> have not I that evil in my heart? So it is repor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed of <hi>Bradford,</hi> that vvhen he ſaw others commit ſin, he vvould fal a vveeping, and a lamenting, becauſe he was afraid that there vvas that evil in himſelf that he ſaw in others, though it did not break forth. An humble heart, vvhen it hears the threatnings of the vvord againſt any ſin, it begins to think thus, And doth not this belong to me? I am afraid that it may belong to me as vvel as to any others, very ſuſpicious and jealous of it ſelf. That is the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An humble heart is unfeignedly vvilling to know the vvorſt of it ſelf; and therefore it makes much of any truth that comes the neareſt to its heart, and that diſcovers it ſelf unto it ſelf, it is glad of thoſe truths, vvhen there is a truth comes home to it, to diſcover any evil that it did not ſee before, it is glad of thoſe truths, and bleſſeth God that it comes to know any thing of it ſelf more than formerly; whereas a proud heart vvil rather vex vvhen any truth comes to diſcover any evil that it did not ſee before, As ſome being deformed, are not vvilling to have a Glaſs to preſent their true I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to them, but an humble heart cries to God, <hi>Lord try me,</hi> Lord diſcover to me vvhat evil is in my heart. And an humble heart loves that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that vvil help it to ſee vvhat evil there is in it ſelf, or any vvay may diſcover vvhat evil there is in it, and it vvil be meditating upon thoſe things that may further diſcover it ſelf, unfeignedly vvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to know the vvorſt of it ſelf: for vvant of this many a Soul goes on in an unſound falſe vvay, and miſcarries to all eternity, becauſe it is not willing
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:168534:43"/> to know the vvorſt of it ſelf. That is the ſecond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An humble Spirit doth often look back to its poor beginnings, it loves to do it, one that is lowly in heart, doth love to be often looking back to its poor beginnings, what once he was. If God hath made an alteration in my condition, let me conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what once I was, what a vile wretch once I was, loves to be often meditating upon that, and ſo to be working upon it ſelf to humble its own heart with ſuch thoughts as thoſe are, Oh! what a poor condition! was I not long ſince in, both in regard of my outward condition, and my inward ſpirituall condition: An humble heart is not unwilling to be put in mind of both. If God hath raiſed him from the Dunghil to a higher condition, he puts himſelf in mind of what he was once, is not willing to have the record of his own Parentage to be razed out, but is willing to have it known what he was, what poor breeding he had, my Father a poor Man, and my Mother a poor Woman, and how poorly they lived notwithſtanding God hath raiſed my eſtate, he is willing to put himſelf in mind of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he may get his proud heart to be humbled. <hi>Agatha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> that was raiſed to be a Prince, he would be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Earthen Veſſels, to put him in mind of his low condition that once he was in. And that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry famous that we have of <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Gen. 32. 10. I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the Mercies and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy Servant, for with my ſtaff have I paſſed over this</hi> Jordan, <hi>and now I am become two bands,</hi> I had nothing but even the poor Staff to paſs over this <hi>Jordan</hi> withall, <hi>but now I am become two bands;</hi> ſo for men that perhaps came up to the City, and that are come to live wel, they were poor Boyes, and had little at firſt, and God hath bleſt their Eſtates, and they are not unwilling to look back to what they
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:168534:44"/> were, it may be ſome of you, were poor ſhip Boyes, and God hath in ſome Voyages raiſed you up to what you are, Do you look back to what you were? and that in the preſence of God, and to that end that your hearts may be humble and low, Do you make that uſe of what your poor condition was? Or rather do not you forget your poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and now your mind is puft up, this is an evil ſight. And another example for this you have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife in <hi>David, David</hi> was exceeding willing to be put in mind of the mean condition in which he was as that in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. when <hi>Nathan</hi> came to him when he would have built an Houſe to God, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. the Lord bids <hi>Nathan</hi> go to him and ſay to him, <hi>I have taken thee from the Sheep-fold</hi> verſe 8. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, I took thee from the Sheep-cote, from following the ſheep, to be Ruler over my People, over Iſrael.</hi> Now <hi>David</hi> was not offended at this, but he bleſſed God at verſe 18. <hi>He went in and ſate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and he ſaid, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my Houſe that thou haſt brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto?</hi> ſtands a wondring at Gods mercy, that God had brought him ſo far as he had done, unto ſuch a comfortable condition, as indeed the Lord had brought him to. And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. he looks back to what he once was, ſaith he, <hi>who was before a Blaſphemer, and a Perſecutor, and injurious, but I obtained mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe I did it ignorantly in unbelief, and the Grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant, with Faith and Love which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who was <hi>before a Blaſpemer and a Perſecutor.</hi> And ſo he ſaith of himſelf, that he was <hi>the leaſt of all</hi> (which afterwards we ſhal further make uſe of) the leaſt of the Saints. Thus one that is lowly in heart, is willing to rip up his former life, and conſider what a poor wretch once I was, what an Ignorant ſottiſh Creature I was, knew nothing of God, nor Chriſt,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:168534:44"/> nor the things of eternity, I vvas not able to open my heart to God in Prayer any further than I had learned it, and could look upon a Book. What a mercy of God is it, in that God hath ſhewed himſelf further to me; and ſo the heart vvorks upon the low condition that once it was in. And ſo in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. vvhen the Lord vvould humble his People, there the greateſt part of the Chapter is ſpent in ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing vvhat they vvere. <hi>Thy Father was an Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and thy Mother an Hitite,</hi> ſhewing thereby, that the Lord vvould have us look back to vvhat once we vvere, that thereby our hearts may be kept low. And indeed by this means an humble heart ſees hovv ſtrange the vvorkings of God vvas to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards it, and vvhat it might have been at preſent, had it not been for the meer mercy of God. This is the thing, vvherein the frame of an humble heart conſiſts in reſpect to it ſelf, it looks back to the poor mean condition that once it vvas in.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the midſt of al the excellencies that God doth give unto an humble heart, yet he is aſhamed of himſelf, or rather thus: An humble heart is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it ſelf, yea, even vvhen God beſtovvs the greateſt excellencies of all upon him, In <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. vvhen <hi>Ezra</hi> vvas humbling himſelf before the Lord together with the Church, he ſaith thus, <hi>We are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of our ſelves and confounded becauſe of this.</hi> And in <hi>Jerem. 31. 19. Ephraim</hi> humbles himſelf and <hi>ſmiting upon his Thigh</hi> he confeſſeth that he vvas <hi>aſhamed.</hi> And ſo the Church ſpeaks in <hi>Jerem. 3. 25. We lie down in our ſhame.</hi> An humble ſpirit is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of himſelf; vvhatever others think of him, yet ſuch a one is conſcious of ſo much evill in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he is humbled vvhen he looks upon his black Legs: though others may think, O! ſuch a one hath excellent abilities, and the like; yet an
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:168534:45"/> humble ſpirit hath ſuch thoughts of it ſelf, as makes it aſhamed of it ſelf. And ſo, in <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. it was the time when God began to bring them from Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and yet that was the time when they were aſhamed of themſelves, and were ſhaming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. One that is of a lowly heart, the behavior of it ſelf is to loath and abhor it ſelf, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 9. there ſaith the Prophet. <hi>And they that eſcape of you ſhall remember me among the Nations whither they ſhal be carried Captives, becauſe I am broken with their whoriſh heart, which hath departed from me, and with their Eyes which go a whoring after their Idols, and they ſhal loath themſelves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations,</hi> It is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Scripture this, <hi>I am broken with your whoriſh heart,</hi> and they ſhall ſee this how their ſins they have broken the very heart of God, we have not ſuch an expreſſion that I know in Scripture that might humble the heart of a ſinner more than this, What! have I by my ſins broken the heart of God? what cauſe is there that my heart ſhould be broken? and when they ſhall ſee this, they ſhall loath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. An humble heart when it ſees what it hath done towards God, doth loath it ſelf, looks upon it ſelf with abhorring. So you have it likewiſe in <hi>Ezek. 20. 4. And there you ſhal remember your waies, and all your doings, wherein ye have been defiled, and you ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for all your evil that you have committed.</hi> And the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion you have in <hi>Ezek. 36. 31. Then ſhall ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your own evil waies, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight for your iniquity and for your abominations,</hi> and this was in a time of mercy, that is obſervable, it was in a time when the Lord promiſed mercy,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:168534:45"/> and did ſhew mercy to them, even then they ſhall <hi>loath themſelves.</hi> Many men they may be brought down ſo low upon their ſick beds, with ſome loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Diſeaſe that may be upon them, that may force them to loath themſelves; but here is the property of an humble Spirit when the Lord ſhews the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt mercy, when it is in the greateſt proſperity, then an humble heart loaths it ſelf before the Lord. And that is a notable Scripture that we have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in <hi>Job</hi> for this purpoſe in <hi>Job 9. 21. Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my Soul, I would deſpiſe my life though I were perfect, I would even deſpiſe and loath my ſelf,</hi> that is, though he were not ſo pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted as others charge him withall, yea, though he were not able to ſee nothing in himſelf; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo that other place in <hi>Job</hi> that I named about the Souls behavior before God, when he ſaw the Glory of God, In <hi>Job</hi> 42. 5. I <hi>have h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. The behavior of a Lowly heart in reſpect of it ſelf, it is to judg it ſelfe, judgeth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Unworthy of any imployment, unworthy of any ſervice that ever God ſhould imploy him in. So you have it in that of <hi>Gideon,</hi> in <hi>Judges</hi> 6. 15.
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:168534:46"/> when the Lord had revealed to <hi>Gideon</hi> what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment he would uſe him in, <hi>Who am I ſaith he, or my Fathers Houſe?</hi> He judgeth himſelf unworthy of any ſuch imployment, one lowly in Heart doth think it a great mercy of God to be imployed in any work, it judgeth it ſelf unworthy of ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h a mercy as this. May be you may think that God ſhould be beholding to you to imploy you in any work or ſervice for him, but if your heart were Lowly, you would judg your ſelves unworthy to be imployed in any work of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It judgeth it ſelf unworthy of the leaſt of the Creatures of God, I <hi>am leſs then the leaſt of all thy mercies,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob,</hi> unworthy of the to bread that it Eates, and the Air that it breathes in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it doth not think much that it hath not what others have, but judgeth it ſelf before God unworthy of what it hath, acknowledging that it hath forfeited all the comforts that God hath vouchſafed to it.</p>
               <p>Yea, Thirdly, It is ready to charge it ſelf with any evil, even that which comes in ſomtimes by temptation; an humble heart is ready charge it ſelf to be the only cauſe of it: as other men, <hi>Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> they are ready to charge temptation with what comes from their own corruption; So an humble heart rather chargeth its own corruption with what comes from temptation. You ſhal have vaine and carnal Spirits, think to excuſe the evil that comes from them with this, the Devil tempted them, this was a temptation, the ſtrength and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a temptation, and they were led to it by the Devil, and ſo judg the Devil for it, and not themſelves, whereas the truth is, it was not thy
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:168534:46"/> temptation ſo much as thy corruption, the heart that is lowly and humble chargeth himſelf with all; this is my corruption, this is my wretched and wicked heart, it is true, the Devil might tempt me, but were it not for my corruption the Devil could never prevaile.</p>
               <p>Yea, Laſtly, It judgeth it ſelf worthy to be deſtroyed. So that place in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36 31. Whereas ſome Books have it <hi>You ſhall loath your ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The old Tranſlation hath it, <hi>And ſhall judg your ſelves worthy to be deſtroyed,</hi> A Lowly heart is willing to paſs ſentence upon it ſelf, to accuſe it ſelf before the Lord, and therefore paſſeth the ſentence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death upon it ſelf, ſo as to juſtifie God, God is clear when he judgeth, whatever the judgment of God is againſt the ſin that I have committed, I joyn with it, I cloſe with the judgment, and I judg my ſelf as God doth judg in his word, it takes the ſentence of Gods word and laies it to it ſelf, and judgeth it ſelf. <hi>If you judg your ſelves, you ſhall not be judged,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. This is the work of a Lowly Spirit, it judgeth it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. That is the Sixth.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, An Humble Spirit denies it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It denies its own Reaſon, if the truth of God be revealed in his word, he wil not ſet his own Reaſon againſt the evidence of the truth, but though I cannot ſee a Reaſon of what is in the word, it is fit that I ſhould yeild to what the Lord reveales in his wodr, it is willing to deny his Reaſon in matters of Faith, and there is a great deal in this, and a ſpecial ground why the Lord batters the Heart of ſinners many times, it is to bring them down to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their own reaſon. So I remember <hi>Luther</hi> hath a ſpeech concerning Reaſon in matters of Faith, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:168534:47"/> it is a moſt bitter enemy to God, and of Faith, he means unſanctified Reaſon, now an humble heart can deny its own Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Yea, Secondly: He is much in denyal of his own will, though my will be ſet ſtrong to have ſuch and ſuch a thing, yet what great matter is it, ſaith a Lowly heart, for the will of ſuch a wretched Creature as I am to be croſſed? What if my will be croſſed, and that for ever? I that have been guilty of croſſing God ſo much, an humble heart never thinks much to have its will to be croſſed: whereas there is nothing more todious and grievous to a proud Spirit, then to have its will croſſed, but now when we can get that power over our ſelves, as to be willing to deny our own wils, then our hearts are indeed broken, and we are brought to be lowly in heart before the Lord, the heart of a ſinner is never broken and humble til it can deny its own will, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you would know when you are humble enough, if you find this, that whereas before you thought it very much to have your wils croſſed, you find now that it is a very little matter to you to have your wills croſſed, this is a ſign that your heart is humble.</p>
               <p>And Thirdly, An Humble ſpirit can deny his own ends, whatever my ends were wont to be, what plottings, contrivings, what deſignes I was wont to aime at; now I find I can deny them, I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce mine own ends, and am not for my ſelf, an humble Spirit is not a ſelfiſh Spirit, not aiming at his own ends.</p>
               <p>Yea, Further: An humble heart can deny its own lawful contentments for God, even thoſe things that are in themſelves lawful contentments, that it might have much liberty in, yet if I ſee that God may have more honor by my being abridged of
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:168534:39"/> ſuch lawful contentments, and my Brethren may have more good, I am willing to deny my ſelf in them, to let them go, it is not fit I ſhould look after my ſelf, ſuch a wretched Creature as I am, that might have been in Hell long ago, it is not ſo much for me to look at my ſelf, but if God may have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Glory, and my Brethren any good, I am willing to deny my own lawfull contentments: ſo that an humble Spirit denies, not only its ſinful ſelf, but its lawful ſelf, denies all its own excellencies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, willing that they ſhould be buried, denies his own honor, cares not for his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, I have been perhaps of ſuch an opinion, and if I ſhould alter I ſhould be diſhonored and diſgraced, but if the truth of God may come up, let my honor lie in the duſt, let the truth of God be advanced, he is willing to deny himſelf. This is the behavior of a lowly Spirit in regard of it ſelf, it doth deny it ſelf, and that is the Leſſon that Chriſt would have us indeed learn. <hi>Come, if you would be my Diſciples, you muſt deny your ſelf, and take up my Croſs.</hi> The word in the Greek is more than <hi>deny your ſelves,</hi> you muſt <hi>throughly deny your ſelf,</hi> deny your ſelf to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe indeed, if you will be the <hi>Diſciples of Chriſt,</hi> and indeed, this Humility is the proper Chriſtian Humility. Your Heathens, they were altogether for men to know their own excellencies, and to ſeek themſelves altogether, but for ſuch a Leſſon as this, to deny themſelves, you never read of any ſuch thing in Heathen Authors, never ſuch a Leſſon that they would teach them, that they would deny themſelves.</p>
               <p n="8">8. An humble heart keeps down it ſelf: that is, he would be no higher except he be worthier, one that hath a vain, proud Spirit, ſtil would fain be higher and higher, and is not ſo ſolicitous to be
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:168534:40"/> worthier of a higher place; but one that is humble thinks thus, I am unworthy of what place I am in, and I would not be higher except I be worthier, I would not be in a higher condition except God give me a heart to improve that condition that he ſhall put me into, and though God keep me in a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in reſpect of outwards, yet the truth is, I have as much as I have Grace to manage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when there is any riſing thoughts within it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a higher condition, an humble heart is willing to beat down it ſelf, and is ready to ſpeak to it ſelf, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> to <hi>Baruch</hi> in <hi>Jerem. 45. Doſt thou ſeek great things for thy ſelf? Seek them not:</hi> So ſaith an humble Spirit to it ſelf, What! art thou riſing in thy Spirit, <hi>and ſeekeſt great things for thy ſelf? Seek them not, it is well thou haſt thy life for a prey,</hi> it is well thy Soul may be ſaved in the day of Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo <hi>David</hi> it is ſaid of him in <hi>Pſal. 131. As a weaned Child he quieted himſelf,</hi> and behaved himſelf, reſtraining himſelf, and keeping down himſelf; whereas his Spirit would have been froward againſt God, he did keep down his Spirit that was ready even to riſe againſt God. One that hath a lowly heart, yet whilſt it remains in this world, hath much to do to keep dovvn it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="9">9. An humble lovvly Spirit hides it ſelf, is vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hide it ſelf, and doth much hide it ſelf, it doth therefore good in ſecret more than in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, though ſuch a one, vvhen God cals him to publique ſervice, is vvilling to ſerve God publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet eſpecially is vvilling to do good in ſecret, vvhere none knows vvhat it doth, and vvhere none is conſcious to it ſelf but it ſelf, and God. The ful ears of Corn hang down vvhereas the blaſted ears vvil ſtand bolt upright: So it is vvith a heart that is humble, the more excellency it hath the more it hangs dovvn it ſelf and is lovv, vvhereas the blaſted
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:168534:40"/> Spirits of Men and women that have a little in them, they ſtand bolt upright. Or rather as the Violet, the Violet doth hide it ſelf with its own Leaves, So the Fig Tree; and the Violet grows low in the ground, you can hardly perceive it, but only it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it ſelf by its ſweet ſmel, you may many times ſmel it before you can ſee it, it grows ſo low, and the diſcovery of it is from the ſweet ſavor of it: and ſo it is with an humble heart, the diſcovery of the excellency that is in an humble heart is from the ſweet ſavor it hath, rather than from any comenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it ſelf by ſpeaking of it ſelf, No, it is that which is abhorred by a lowly humble heart to be ſpeaking high things of it ſelf: and it doth not love to hear others commending of it, and doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them in a modeſty, becauſe they would have them to confirm it the more ſtrongly, as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will do, but unfeignedly is willing to have them hidden, any futher than God is pleaſed to draw them forth. It doth a great deal of good when no body can know it, as it was the ſimilitude of an Antient, ſaith he, <hi>An humble heart in this is like to the Lightening, that may work ſtrong effects on a ſuddain, and goes away and no body takes notice of it, ſomtimes it may be melts the Sword in the Scabbard, and is gone and no body knows who did it:</hi> So it is with an humble heart, it wil not make a noiſe in what it doth; whereas a proud heart wil be brought to no good exerciſe except every one take notice of what it doth, an humble Spirit is willing to hide it ſelf when God may nay have Glory by an action, though I may have diſgrace, yet I am content.</p>
               <p n="10">10. An humble Spirit goes out of it ſelf, being conſcious of its own weakneſs, I ſay, it goes out of it ſelf for a principle to act by, and for ſtrength, for aſſiſtance, for help, it goes out of it ſelf, and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:168534:41"/> it ſelf; we may put both together, it is unbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed of it ſelf, is one that is willing to live upon Alms, upon Gods Alms continually, upon a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued influence of the Grace of God, being ſenſible of its own weakneſs, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> goes out to catch hold of ſtrength without it ſelf; Like the Vine, though a fruitful Creature, yet a weak Creature, therefore God in nature hath made it ful of little ſtrings, to catch hold of any thing that is next it, to ſupport it ſelf: So it is with an humble Spirit, though very fruitfull yet weak, and therefore is catching hold of ſtrength without it ſelf, ſupports it ſelf upon God, and therefore it dares not go forth in its own ſtrength <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n any buſineſs that God ſets it about, but is unbotomed of it ſelf, depends upon a ſtrength be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its ſelf and looks for aſſiſtance in all actions that it doth from another, it lives upon a principle that is without it ſelf continually, whereas a proud heart lives altogether upon its own principles: But there is nothing more diſcovers our humilty than this, than to live upon nothing in our ſelves, but to go out to ſtrength without our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="11">11 This is the true behavior of an humble Spirit in reſpect of it ſelf, a lowly and humble Spirit is often bemoaning it ſelf alone, for its own wretchedneſs and vileneſs, in <hi>Jerem. 31. 13. I have heard of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim <hi>bemoaning himſelf before the Lord, I have heard him bemoaning himſelf. Is not</hi> Ephraim <hi>my dear Child?</hi> ſaith God, Oh! how frequently doth the Lord hear lowly hearts <hi>bemoaning</hi> of themſelves before the Lord. It may be it doth not pine ſo much before others in complaints, but gets into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, and there it is often bemoaning it ſelf, and pouring forth it ſelf before the Lord.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The laſt is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an humble heart doth afflict it ſelf, is willing to afflict it ſelf, you know that the Lord requires (in the day of a Faſt eſpecially)
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:168534:41"/> that there ſhould be an afflicting of our ſelves, In <hi>Levit.</hi> 23. 26. The Text ſaith, <hi>That every Soul ſhould afflict it ſelf, and that Soul that doth not afflict it ſelf in the day of a faſt ſhouldbe cut off.</hi> Now an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Soul is an afflicted ſoul, is willing to afflict it ſelf before the Lord, it is not ſo much ſollicitous of comfort, and is altogether for comfort, would fain have comfort: and comfort, no, but is willing to afflict it ſelf, and to burden it ſelf with its own ſin, and to beat down it ſelf, as we read of <hi>Paul 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 27. the Text ſaith, <hi>He beat down his body, leaſt after he had Preached unto others, he himſelf ſhould be a Reprobate:</hi> Not to afflict our ſelves as Papiſts, to be whipping our ſelves, and to do thoſe things that God never aequired at our hands, but ſo far as any way God ſhal require it, ſuch a one is willing to afflict it ſelf before the Lord, the main work of the heart in this thing is, that it is not ſollicitous ſo much for comfort, as to be willing to be afflicted before the Lord, ſo far as God would have it affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>So now put all theſe together, and you may ſee the behavior of a lowly heart in reſpect of it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. It is ſuſpicious of it ſelf jealous leaſt the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Firſt: Here you may ſee, how to examine your own hearts in reſpect of Humility, whether you find theſe workings of an humble ſpirit in reſpect of your ſelves, lay theſe and your hearts Level, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine and call your hearts to an account when you get alone, By theſe twelve foregoing Particulars, Ask thy ſelf as in the preſence of God: Is my heart thus? Have I this lowly heart? Chriſt would have me of a lowly heart, Thus if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find theſe, charge your ſelves with the want of them, and take an advantage even from the want of them to humble your hearts before the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have not theſe things that are the genuine and naturall workings of an humble Spirit, for ſo they are. if you can find your hearts coming off in in theſe Particulars, in a natural way, from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed nature, you may have abundance of comfort that this Grace of Humility, of Lowlineſs that Chriſt would have you learn, is wrought in your Souls: you have been a Proficient in Chriſts School, but many may have cauſe upon the hearing of this, to charge themſelves with this, that they ſcarce have begun to learn in the School of Chriſt, to learn Humility.</p>

The Life of a Chriſtian were a great deal more eaſie, but from this that you hear, from the working of this one Grace of Humility, you may ſee, that the work of a Chriſtian lies much within doors, that Chriſtians ſhould be very buſie within their hearts, there are many workings within rather then without, and therefore if you would profeſs your ſelves to be Chriſtians, and would indeed have the power of Godlineſs in your Hearts, you muſt work <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We have <hi>Gideon</hi> likewiſe an example of Lowlineſs of Spirit in his own Eyes, (we might name a great many others) when ſome were provoked and Angry with him, he ſaid unto them, <hi>what have I done now in compariſon of you, is not the gleaning of the Grapes of Ephraim bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the vintage of</hi> Abiezer? By this means he pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified his angry Brethren, ſaith he, we account our ſelves but as the <hi>Gleanings of the Grapes of</hi> Ephraim <hi>to the vintage of</hi> Abiezer. And by that means he quieted his Brethren that were provoked. Well, but for the opening of this, the Lowly heart doth judg others better then himſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If ſo be that there appear any evil in others, if the evil be not apparent in other men, a Lowly heart wil be ready to judg the beſt of any one, and
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:168534:48"/> think there is more good ſecretly. If there appear but a little good, yet it will be ready to think that others have more good in ſecret then he hath himſelf, I know how little good I have in ſecret in mine own heart, ſaith a lowly Soul, Well, but I do not know but ſuch and ſuch may have a great deal more good in ſecret then I have, their thoughts may be more holy, more ſpiritual then mine, not ſo wandring in Duties as mine are, I have no Reaſon to think any in the world have ſo many wandring thoughts, and ſuch uncleanneſs and filthineſs in their thoughts as I have. It is ready to think, that the affections of others are a great deal more cleane then his, and more Heavenly and ſpiritual, and prepared more for holy duties, and that their hearts are in a better temper in holy Duties then his is. And if ſo be that there be any good done by others, he is ready to think, that ſurely there is in them better principles, that acts better in their minds then there is in me, they do ſuch and ſuch good things, I and their hearts are more ſincere, and are carried on by divine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in what they do, I am conſcious to my ſelf of a great many of baſe and vile principles that act in me, I know no ſuch evil in others, and therefore I am to hope that there is not the like in them as there is in me. If he ſees any good in another, a lowly heart is ready to think that there are other things correſpondent to the good that doth appear unto him, as there appears ſuch a good thing, ſo there is all other things anſwerable unto that good that doth appeare, but as for it ſelf it ſaies, I find though I do ſomthing that is good, Yet I am conſcious to my ſelf that there is a great deal of non-correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in me, that though there be ſuch and ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good things yet other things are not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto that that doth appear. Thus becauſe one that is lowly knows much evil of it ſelf, and knows
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:168534:49"/> more evil of it ſelf then it doth of any other, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſees cauſe to judg of others better then it ſelf, I do not know that ſuch have ſuch ſecret evils as my ſelf, I do not know that they have ſuch baſe principles that act them as in my ſelf, that there is ſuch a non-correſpondency to good as in my ſelf, upon this ground, becauſe it knows more evil of it ſelf then others know, therefore it is ready to think better of others then of it ſelf.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I but you wil ſay, <hi>Suppoſe I ſee a great deal of Evil in others that I know, and am conſcious to my ſelf that I am not guilty of, ſhall I think better of others then of my ſelf then?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer ſtil, for all this I am to think of others better then my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe, though I ſee others out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly evil, yet I do not know whether there be ſuch inward evil in them as in my ſelf, it is true, they do break into outward evils more then I do, I but there may be ſwarmes of evils within me that I know I am guilty of, now becauſe I know more evil inwardly in my ſelf, then I can know in any in the world, therefore I am bound to judg of others better then of my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And further, Though I ſee ſome evil in others that I am not guilty of, yet how do I know what temptations they have, and how can I tel, but that if I had as great temptations as they I might commit as great evils and greater then they; and therefore, though they do commit greater evils then I do, yet I am bound to judg of them better then my ſelf, becauſe I do not know but if I had as ſtrong temptations as they, I might commit greater evils.</p>
               <pb n="563" facs="tcp:168534:49"/>
               <p>Yea Thirdly, Though they do commit evils grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I do, yet I know that it is the reſtraining hand of God upon me, and that if God ſhould but leave me to my ſelf a little, as he leaves ſuch a one, I ſhould be as vile as ſuch a one, and it may be viler: ſo that though the Saints of God muſt not wrong the grace of God, muſt not (if they ſee one live in notorious wickedneſs) think that his condition is better then mine, but yet he may be better then I, conſidering my ſelf meerly in my ſelf, I have no cauſe to lift up my ſelf above him, if I be better it is no thanks to me, it is not becauſe I am better in my ſelf, for I have that evil in my ſelf, that if God ſhould take off his hand, and leave me to my ſelf as he leaves ſuch and ſuch, I ſhould be as bad as they; you are to look upon your ſelves, that there is not any vile wretch in the Town or Family where you live though they be the worſt of men, that are more vile and wretched then you are. Yea, And for ought you know viler, that is, if you ſhould be left to your ſelf, you may be viler then they are, and ſo an humble heart is willing thus to judg of others better then it ſelf.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I, But you will ſay, <hi>For thoſe that are notoriouſly prophane, and ungodly, for us to judg them better then our ſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how can we do this without being falſe? And doth not the Scripture ſay,</hi> The Righteouſs is better then his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, Yet we are to look upon others better then our ſelves in theſe reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt: They had not ſuch education as you had they had not ſuch droppings in of God as I had when I was young, they lived in a wicked Family, and had
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:168534:50"/> wicked Parents, but I had Godly Parents, had they had ſuch Godly Parents and good education as I, they might have been better, and done better, it may be they have been caſt among thoſe that have given them wicked examples to provoke to ſin, but I have had Gracious examples, it may be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lived under ſuch means as I have, had ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious truths, ſuch heart melting truths been preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before others, as hath been preſented before me, they might have wrought upon the heart of the vileſt in the world more than they have upon my heart, it may be they have not had the awakings of Conſcience, God never darted that light into their Conſciences as into mine, they never had the terrors in their Spirits as I have had, God never made them know what ſin meant as he hath done me, had God inlightened them as he hath done me, and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened their Conſciences, and terrified them as he hath done me, Surely, there would not have remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch evil in them as is in me, they never had ſuch drawings of Gods ſpirit (it may be) as I have had, O! the allurements of Gods Spirit that I have had, to have drawn me away from ſin, and to have drawn me to that that is good, and yet how did I keep back? Do I wonder to ſee them drawn by vain and wicked Company? What great wonder is it when they have nothing elſe to draw them back? But had they the drawings of the Holy Ghoſt, and thoſe words of love, and thoſe ſtirrings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in them as I have had, and as I have dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how would they be as ready to be drawn to good as they are to evil? I wonder that they are not moved more by the word, I but my heart is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the drawings of Gods Spirit, had they but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted how ſweet God is, they never taſted the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the word, nor the ſweetneſs that there is in
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:168534:50"/> the waies of God as I have done, had they taſted what I have taſted, and felt what I have felt, it would have been better with them than it is with me. And ſo many ſuch Conſiderations being put into the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, though others be very vile and wicked, yet we have good reaſon to look upon others better than our ſelves, at leaſt to look upon our ſelves as vile as any in the world; yea viler, becauſe (I ſay) we cannot know what helps others have had, nor what inward good is in others, as we may of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly: And further, We have cauſe to judg of others better than our ſelves, though prophane and wicked, for their ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You think thoſe notorious wretches, that take Gods name in vain, and ſwear, but I ſay thou polluteſt Gods name more by thy Paſſion, and it may be putteſt off many from Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion more by thy froward carriage than Swearing doth in another man; for it is true, they ſin againſt God, but what hurt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And by the way therefore let this Conſideration teach thoſe that are wicked, let it inform them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in a miſtake of theirs, They think thoſe that profeſs religion do judg of others worſe than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, now by this that you hear you may know that it is quite otherwiſe, had you but a Window opened into their boſome, into their heart you would find that they look upon none living ſo vile as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <p>Now to that I anſwer.</p>
               <p>Though they are to judg of themſelves worſe than others, yet if thou wouldſt look into thine own heart, thou mai'ſt ſee a great deal more evil in thy heart than is in theirs, it may be they may judg themſelves to be worſe than thee, ſo far as they ſee into themſelves, but thou maiſt ſee more evil in thy heart than is in theirs.</p>

Oh! the ſad condition that that man is in! the truth is, it is a very daunting conſideration, for a man to think thus, there are ſuch and ſuch that are as bad as I, and have as bad hearts as I, and yet God for the preſent hath left me unchoſen, and hath choſe them, this ſhould daunt the heart of any man. Haſt thou not known ſome wicked Companion of thine own, ſome wicked Woman or Siſter that God hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to dart light into them, and humbled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them, and hath left thee that art not ſo vile?

What a dangerous ſign is this that I am not one that God will chooſe? though I do not know what God may do hereafter, but for the preſent (I ſay) thou haſt cauſe to be humbled, and not to reſt in this condition. Wel, That is the firſt thing.

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſecond Property of Humility in reſpect of others is, To be fearfull of giving Offence</hi>-</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SEcondly: Another thing in the behavior of an humble Spirit in reſpect of others is this, It is very fearful of giving offence to others, and not very ready to take offence from others. I will put both together. It will not give offence to others, and that you have very frequently in Scripture in <hi>Rom. 14. 10. But why doſt thou judg thy Brother? or why doſt thou ſet at naught thy Brother? We ſhall all ſtand before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt.</hi> Now this is in caſe of giving offence to others, that is the plain ſcope of this place, the Argument that is driven at in this 14. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> it is the Argument of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving offence to our Brethren, and here you may perceive in this place the Reaſon why men do not care what offence they give unto others, why they ſet at naught their Brethren, and judg them. Why doſt thou ſet at naught thy Brother? Why doſt thou make thy Brother as no body to thee? ſo the Greek, one that hath a <hi>proud</hi> heart, if he think he hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty himſelf for ſuch and ſuch things, what cares he for others? Others are offended and grieved, but what cares he for <hi>others? they are no body to him,</hi> he maketh nothing of them: For that is the word, Why doſt thou ſet at naught thy Brother, in being careleſs in giving offence unto thy Brother? Oh, this is the pride of thy heart, a gracious heart is loath to grieve any body in the world, ſo in the
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:168534:53"/> 15. verſe of this Chap. <hi>But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not Charitably, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt dyed.</hi> There the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhewes, that he was loath, and ſo he would have all the <hi>Romans</hi> to be loath ſo much as to grieve their brother. O! this is a very gracious Lowly ſpirit indeed, that is ſo tender of others that he is not willing to grieve any one in the world, he is ſo with others, as he is afraid to be a grief to others; here is a Spirit that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall have a great deal of Glory from, that lives ſo, as that he is careful and very tender of grieving the ſpirits of others. It was a Speech once of a great Captain, <hi>a Roman,</hi> when others commended the great Exploits he did, I but ſaith he, <hi>I Bleſs God never any one wore a Mourning Garment for my ſake,</hi> Oh, It is a bleſſed thing, for a man or woman to go out of the world ſo, that every one can ſay, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any wore a mourning Garment for ſuch a man or woman. In <hi>Phillip. 2. 3. Let nothing be done through ſtrife, or vain glory, but in Lowlineſs of mind, let each eſteem others better then themſelves.</hi> Verſe, 4 <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others, let this mind be in you which was alſo in Jeſus Chriſt, who being in the form of God &amp;c.</hi> Do not <hi>look upon your own things</hi> but <hi>upon the things of others,</hi> And be careful not to be offenſive to any body living, not to be occaſion of grief to any body. And ſo in <hi>Rom. 15. 2. Let every one of us pleaſe his Neighbor for his good to Edification, for even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf, but as it is written, the reproaches of them that reproached thee fel upon me.</hi> We ſhould be careful not to pleaſe our ſelves but our Neighbor from the Example of Chriſt, now what is his Example? But that here in the Text, <hi>Learn of me for I am Lowly.</hi> Chriſt, though he were ſo great, that
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:168534:54"/> he ſtood in no need of any body he was God bleſſed for ever in himſelf, yet he did not ſeek to pleaſe himſelf but others, for the Text ſaith, for even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf, but as it is written, the reproaches of them that reproached thee fel on me. Now ſtil this is in deference to the caſe of offence, for ſo you ſee in the beginning of the Chapter, <hi>We then that are ſtrong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe our ſelves, Let every one pleaſe his Neighbor, not pleaſe our ſelf, but every one pleaſe our Neighbor,</hi> And that according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Jeſus Chriſt, in this Lowlineſs of heart. To ſee Men and Women to walk ſo, as not to care to give content to any body but themſelves in the Family, they muſt have al the content and no body elſe pleaſed: And ſo among their Neighbors, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and companies, they expect that every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Company ſhould ſpeak ſo as to pleaſe them, but they care not to ſpeak ſo as to pleaſe others: but here is the guiſe of a Lowly ſpirit, to be careful not ſo much to pleaſe it ſelf, as to pleaſe others, is careful not to offend others though it may not pleaſe it ſelf, is ſolicitous and ſtudious how he may give content to others, and no way to offend them, that he may no way be an offence unto another, and if they hear any thing that is offenſive indeed unto another, and is a grief to the Soul of another, they are much in the denial of themſelves in the thing they require, that they may give content to them; here is the guiſe of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit, it is affraid to offend others. So in 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 32. 33. Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Genteles, nor to the Church of God, even as I pleaſe al men in al things, not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will ſay, We muſt be careful to give no
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:168534:54"/> offence to the Saints and Church of God; Nay, ſaith he, give not offence only to them, but to the Jew, the Gentiles and all that live about you, be careful to pleaſe them for good in all that you can, here is the Lowlineſs of the heart of <hi>Paul.</hi> So in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3. There you have another expreſſion of the gracious Lowlineſs of the heart of the Apoſtle, <hi>Giving no offence in any thing, that the miniſtery be not blamed,</hi> This he ſpeaks eſpecially as a miniſter, but it is true in all, but mark what principle it was that carried him, to make him ſo careful not to give offence, verſe, 4. <hi>But in all things approving our ſelves as the miniſters of God, in much patience, in neceſſities, in afflictions, in diſtreſſes,</hi> and ſo he goes on in verſe, 8. <hi>By Honor and diſhonor, by evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and good report, as deceived and yet true,</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, we are willing to bear any thing in the World, rather then to give offence, we are willing to beare reproach, and to be accounted diſhonorable in the World, we are willing to bow down our Necks, to bow down our backs to any thing; this ſhould be the frame of Godly men and Women, of godly Chriſtians. Not as ſoon as ever any thing croſſeth them, preſently to fling off all, and regard nothing any more, No, but to ſubmit to every condition, rather then to be any waies offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive unto others.</p>
               <p>And then likewiſe you muſt take that in too, that an Humble Heart is not ready to take offence from others, as it is Pride of Spirit for one not to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of others whether they be offended or not offended, ſo on the other ſide it is Pride of Spirit to be ready to take offence from others, and by this meanes through their weakneſs they prove to be very burdenſome to others, the ground of their offence is only this, becauſe they think that every
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:168534:55"/> body muſt do as they themſelves, and becauſe they think that ſuch a thing is better, therefore others muſt do it, and if they do not it, then they are lofty, and then they are proud, and ſtout, and you ſhal many times have people that are very weak in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with others, if they cannot bring them to yeild to what they would have, they will break out into very unſeemly ſpeeches, that manifeſt that it is not only through weakneſs, and tenderneſs, but through the pride of their hearts, becauſe they would have every body do as they do. Now an humble ſpirit Reaſons thus, it is true, ſuch and ſuch do ſo and ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and indeed I do not ſee Reaſon why he doth ſo, but he or ſhe ſees more then I do, and therefore though I do not do that that they do, or dare not do that they dare do, yet becauſe they keep cloſe to God, and ſeek to know the mind of God, and are more able to ſearch into the mind of God then I am, and God hath revealed to them more then he hath to me, why ſhould I be offended at my brother, upon that Reaſon I may not be offended. This is an Argument of an humble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Indeed it is true, God doth give you leave, if the matter be of Conſequence, (if any one ſhould walk in a way that you ſhould take upon you in your conſcience that it is a juſt offence to you) to deſire and you may demand a Reaſon of them, and they are bound to give you a Reaſon (for we are bound to give a Reaſon of our Faith) if you come meerly in humility to ask a reaſon of any of our waies, ſo as that you might not be offended, and we ſee that it is through Tenderneſs of Spirit that you are offended, we ought to give account to any that we walk with, I do not ſpeak of any one in any ſociety only that ſhould demand a Reaſon, but if any man living upon the Earth ſhould come in an humble way, not in a peremptory, proud, and
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:168534:55"/> contentious way, to know, and deſire to know the grounds and Reaſons of our actions, becauſe they fear our actions are not according to God, we are bound to do it upon that in <hi>Paul, Give no offence neither to Jew, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God:</hi> If we muſt give no offence, then certainly we are bound to give an account of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctions, ſo as to ſatisfie thoſe that are offended, now though you may require a Reaſon for ſatisfaction, yet when you have a Reaſon, (unleſs it be very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the contrary) ſuppoſe you your ſelves be not ſatisfied, yet if you ſee ſuch and ſuch do walk cloſe with God otherwiſe, then you are rather to judg and think that God hath revealed more to them then he hath to you; and ſo rather to leave them to God then to be ready to be offended, or ſtil continue to be offended, becauſe they do not do as you do, and do not judg what you do to be right, there is a great deal of difference between the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural complections of ſome. As for example, ſome have not their Spirits ſo taken with the things of Religion as others have, and yet are very faithful to God, and keep cloſe to God. Truths they come in by degrees one after another, and therefore it is a notorious and abominable pride in men, to judg of others that they ſhut their Eyes againſt the light, and that they ſin againſt their conſcience becauſe they do not the things that they do. That is the ſecond thing in the behavior of an humble ſpirit in reſpect of others, it is afraid of giving offence to others, and it is not ready to take offence from others.</p>

                  <p>Other Properties of Humility in reſpect of others. 3. It gives due Honor to all with whom it doth converſe. 4. It rejoyceth in their good. 5.

               <p>THirdly, Another thing in an humble Spirit in reference unto others is this, he gives due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and due reſpect unto all living that he doth any way converſe with, in <hi>Rom, 12. 10.

                     </gap>r preferring one another,</hi> Strive who ſhall give moſt honor to one another, Oh, this is a gracious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to ſtrive who ſhal give moſt honor, not who ſhal get moſt honor, who ſhal be moſt honorable and greater then another, <hi>But in honor preferring one another</hi> every man ſhould ſtrive who ſhould give moſt honor to one another, my Brother ſtrives to give reſpect and honor unto me, and I ſhould ſtrive to give more reſpect and honor to him, if I ſhould be above my Brother in any thing, I ſhould ſtrive to give more reſpect to him then he doth to me, quite contrary to the common courſe of the world, how hard is it for men to acknowledg that others have more Grace then they, meerly becauſe they would not give more honor to others then to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, now an humble heart doth this. Men ſhould
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:168534:56"/> give to men due honor, if God hath lifted a man up above me in Eſtate, or in civil reſpects, it may be you think him not ſo gracious a man as you, What then? You are to give him honor according to the place that God hath ſet him in. And ſo in another Relation, as now the Wife to the Husband: For the Husband, apparently the Scripture ſhews that God ſets the Husband above the Wife, perhaps the parentage of the Wife is better then the Husbands, perhaps the Eſtate of the Wife is better then the Husbands, perhaps the gifts of the Wife may be more then the Husbands, the Wife may have more underſtanding in Religion then the Husband hath, yet ſhe muſt Honor her Husband above al, as one that God hath ſet above her. And ſo Servants to Honor their Governors, though they are of greater parentage, may be better then your Maſter or Miſtris, yet God having ſet them over you, you are to give due honor and reſpect to them, this an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Heart will do, and an humble Heart gives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto all. In <hi>Rom. 12. 16. Be of the ſame mind one towards another, Mind not high things, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to men of Low Eſtate,</hi> Here is a lowly heart, he gives honor to thoſe that are above them, and due reſpect to all men in the world, a man, as a man is worthy of ſome reſpect, but then according to any Relation he ſtandeth in, any one that God hath given any place unto above others, ſo we are to give him due reſpect. Perhaps they are meaner in eſtate, lower then thou art in the world, yet mark what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Condeſcend to men of low Eſtate.</hi> You muſt be affable in your carriage to men and women, you muſt not ſcorn, not look with diſdaine upon any though they be never ſo much under you, hath God placed you above them, given you a higher place in eſtate, given you more Riches, better parts, better imployments then
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:168534:57"/> they have, yet you muſt condeſcend to the loweſt, and think with your ſelves, who hath made the difference? I might have been as low in condition and parts as they, and therefore you muſt conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to them, not look above them, not deſpiſe to look upon them, what art thou more then they? Are ye not of the ſame Mould? Are ye not made of the ſame Clay? If you be made of a little more fine Clay then others, If you have a little more painting of fine Cloaths upon your Clay then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, what is that? All outward things make but a little difference between man and man; I confeſs Grace makes a great deal of difference between man and man, but the ordinary way whereby men lift themſelves up above their Brethren, it is becauſe they have finer Cloaths then others, and better Eſtates then others, and better parts then others Alas! If thou haſt wit, and underſtanding, let God but touch thy brain a little with a few humors, with a little too much heat, or cold, or moiſture, or drawing a few ill Vapors out of thy Stomach, thou maieſt go like a Fool or a mad man. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member one <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> who was one of the greateſt ſcorners in the world, yet was many years before he died a very Fool, the parts of a man are very poor things to lift up any man, conſidering how they depend upon a little temper of the brain, and a little ſickneſs may make thee as mad a man as any in <hi>Bedlam,</hi> therefore there is no Reaſon to look upon thy ſelf above others in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another thing in an humble Spirit in reference unto others is this, which is ſomewhat more then the other, he not only gives reſpect, but rejoyceth in the good of others, in whatever excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency God hath beſtowed upon others, in what ſucceſs God gives to others, what eſteem God
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:168534:57"/> hath of others, an humble heart will rejoyce in all, you know, <hi>Paul,</hi> he rejoyced that the Goſpel was Preached, though he was nothing. There are two Caſes in which we are to rejoyce in reſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be glad that others are above us: As firſt, If God raiſeth any in ſpirituall Grace: Doth God give any ſpirituall Grace more than to thee; I ſay, thou art bound not only to be content but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in it, and it is a wickedneſs in the hearts of Men and Women, that becauſe their Glory ſhall be ſomewhat eclipſed by the Graces of others, they could even almoſt wiſh that they did ſomewhat to darken their Graces, becauſe then they ſhould not ſhine ſo bright, and they ſhould be ſome body as well as they, if there be this wickedneſs in thy heart, know, that this is as curſed a wickedneſs as the heart of man is capable of in the world, next to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, there is as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an evil in this diſtemper of thine, as can almoſt be imagined to be in the heart of a man or woman, What! ſhal thy eye be evil becauſe thy Brothers is good? becauſe thy name muſt ſuffer a little, what is thy name, or thy Glory in compariſon of the Glory that God may have by the Grace of thy Brother? And ſo for the gifts of others, not only the Graces, but the gifts of others, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>When the wicked are exalted, the People mourn,</hi> and may not we mourn becauſe the wicked are lifted up? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is the ſecond caſe, when God gives any gifts, ſo as to make another more inſtrumentall for good than he doth our ſelves, we are to rejoyce in that though it be not true Grace, yet if he give any gifts whereby they come to be more inſtrumental for God and his Glory than our ſelves, we are bound to rejoyce in this, and to bleſs God for it, this many times comes very neer the hearts of men, &amp; yet there is infinite reaſon, for what is my name,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:168534:58"/> my credit, my eſtate, in compariſon of the work that is done for God? If I be ſincere for God, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if the work do go on, though not by me, I may rejoyce, if my heart be upright, and be not damnable proud, I am bound to rejoyce in it, and bleſs God, though I can do but little for God, yet bleſſed be God that there be any can do more than I can, this indeed would be a great deal of comfort in your hearts, you complain of your own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, O! you ſay, you cannot pray, when you go to prayer you have a dead heart, I but can you ſay, though I have a ſtrait heart, and cannot pray, Oh, I bleſs God that others have a heart enlarged in prayer, you are not (I hope) wiſhing that others had as ſtraitned hearts as you, And ſo thou haſt a weak memory, and canſt not remember good things, I but bleſſed be God that hath given gifts to others, that they can remember, and that God hath a great deal of Glory by them, and thus when I am in ſecret, in my Cloſet, to be bleſſing of God that he hath given gifts to others, whereby he hath more Glory than by my ſelf. And ſo I might name many particulars that are to be objects of an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart, but humility rejoyceth in other reſpects, and if there be any lifted up above me, God ſees that he is like to do him more ſervice than I, if I ſhould be lifted up as they are, God ſees that I am not able to bear it. It is the ſpeech of old Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> he wiſhed himſelf to be the worſt Preacher in al the world, <hi>I would to God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I were the worſt Preacher in all the Kingdom,</hi> not that he thought himſelf worſe than he was, but this, that he would have all in the Kingdom better than he. You know <hi>Moſes</hi> when they told him of <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad</hi> that propheſied in the Camp, he anſwered, Why doſt thou envy them for my ſake? <hi>I would to God all the Lords People were ſo,</hi> An humble heart
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:168534:58"/> never is troubled that any credit is gotten from him ſo God may have Gloty. When as God choſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to go to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he would have <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Behold</hi> Aaron <hi>he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he ſeeth thee, he will be glad in his heart,</hi> no queſtion but God made known to <hi>Aaron</hi> what his work ſhould be that made him glad at the heart, and though <hi>Aaron</hi> knew <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be above him, and <hi>Aaron</hi> was the elder brother, yet when he met with <hi>Moſes</hi> he was glad at the heart: As if he ſhould ſay, bleſſed be God, though he be my youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother, yet I am willing to further the ſervice that God hath called my younger Brother to; So though thou maieſt think thou haſt other gifts, than other men have, and act above other men, yet if Gods Glory goes on, thou ſhouldeſt bleſs God that his Glory comes about by any others. I remember <hi>Plutarch</hi> tels of one <hi>Philertus</hi> that was in election for a place, and it was a place that three hundred were in nomination, and were choſen before him, he ſhould have been but one of them, and he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way rejoycing, and was glad with this expreſſion, I am glad that there is three hundred in this City better deſerving than my ſelf, not fretting and fuming, but was glad that there was three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred better than himſelf fit for ſuch a place: So ſhould we, knowing how God caſts things in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, rejoyce upon this, that others are found bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: An humble Spirit in reference unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is willing to receive good from the meaneſt, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> there be any one, though never ſo mean, yet he is willing to receive good from him, he doth not ſcorn it becauſe it comes from a mean man, but on the contrary ſaith, Hath God beſtowed any Grace
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:168534:59"/> upon others, though not ſo much as upon me, yet I may get ſome good by them? it may be they have not ſo great gifts as I, I but I may get ſome good by the meaneſt, and the weakeſt, as I have ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, little Chips will kindle great Logs, ſo an humble heart will get ſomthing from the meaneſt, he will go away bleſſing God for the comfort he hath by the company of thoſe that are meaner than himſelf. Mark <hi>Paul;</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt that you would ſtrive together with God for me.</hi> What! this Apoſtle, that was ſo much above them, for them to ſtrive together with God for him: Yes, thus it is with a true gracious heart. I remember I have read of a German Divine, when he lay ſick and ſome of his friends came to him, and would be ſpeaking to him, and they thought it would be grievous to him, becauſe he was ſo weak, Oh, ſaith he (though they were but thoſe that you cal Lay-people) if ſo be that when I die I ſhall learn any thing of any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I ſhould account my departure more ſweet to me. And ſo it was the Speech of <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> If a truth come, though by a Child, by the meaneſt, we muſt not refuſe: But know ſometimes, that God may ſpeak by a poor body, when he doth deny to ſpeak by thoſe of greater abilities, and therefore we do not know what we loſe by contemning thoſe that are under us, for God (I ſay) many times may ſpeak that to our hearts by thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath us, when he denies to ſpeak it by thoſe that are above us. Now an humble Spirit is willing to learn of every body, of the meaneſt, Oh, if there were ſuch a temper in the hearts of Men &amp; Women, what abundance of ſweetneſs and peace might we have? Now by that we have ſaid, you may ſee how the promiſe may be fulfilled, if we had but an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, there would be abundance of reſt that we ſhould have in this, Oh, the abundance of peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:168534:59"/> that there would be in the world, were it not for this pride of heart; it is Pride of heart that makes all this ado and combuſtion in the world, and were we thus carrying our ſelves lowly in heart one towards another, Oh! the reſt that there would be in the world, and in our own Spirits!</p>
               <p>Sixthly: Another is this, An humble heart is a tender heart towards others, a lowly heart is a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heart, In <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3. 12. you have thoſe two put together, <hi>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, Holy and beloved, bowels of mercies and kindneſs hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of mind,</hi> Bowels of mercies and humbleneſs of mind are put together, an humble Spirit is merciful towards others, is of a tender heart, either to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give others, or to give unto others, he readily paſſeth by the offences done by others, he forgives others, he reaſons with himſelf, What am I, that I ſhould think it ſo great a matter for me to be offended, that hath ſinned ſo much againſt God as I have done? Who am I, to take ſo much upon me againſt my Brother that hath offended, when I deſerve to be roaring and yelling in Hell? I that have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny talents forgiven me, Why ſhould not I forgive to others? And then for giving unto others, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, <hi>Who hath made the difference</hi> between me and others? Why is it that I ſhould be able to give, and not to have need of others? Why ſhould my Brother be in ſuch a poor condition and I have ſuch accomodations? An humble hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> loves ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, hath his bowels yern towards the neceſſities of his Brethren, whereas a proud Spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t thinks all is for himſelf, <hi>Shall I give my bread, and my fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my Beer that I have provided for my Servants?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Nabal</hi>) but an humble heart thinks all that he hath is mercy, and therefore gives to others. That which makes men and women ſtand ſo much
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:168534:60"/> upon it, that they will not forgive wrongs, and makes them ſo mercileſs towards others in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, it is from the pide of their Spirits; an humble heart, is a heart tender and melting towards others.</p>
               <p>Seventhly: And then the laſt that I ſhall name is this: That an humble heart is not needleſsly ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar from others; abundance of pride appears in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity: there is a ſingularity that is of neceſſity, that is, we muſt do our Duty, what Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in Duty towards God, though none in the world ſhould do the like: So we ſhould be ſingular, <hi>What ſingular thing do you?</hi> but I ſay, an humble heart is not needleſly ſingular from others, and that you have in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16. it is a notable Scripture for this, <hi>Be of the ſame mind one towards another, mind not high things, but condeſcend to men of low eſtate.</hi> Now the words I confeſs as they are in your Books do not ſeem to hold forth that I bring it for, yet if it be examined as the learned know in the originall it is thus <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, So it is tranſlated, Go the ſame way with thoſe that are of a low eſtate, go on in the ſame way together with them. Do not go in a ſingular way by your ſelves, there is the danger of Pride, for men to go in the way of thoſe that are not mean, they will go on in the way of thoſe that have credit and eſteem in the world, they will not be ſingular from them, here is the Pride of ſingularity for men to be ſingular from poor, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Gracious People, thou Profeſſeſt thy ſelf to be a Chriſtian, and thou canſt comply with men that are full of Pomp, and Glory of the world, and wilt not be ſingular from them: but thou wilt be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar from thoſe that are mean, Godly and gracious ſouls, that is Pride, we muſt go on in the way with thoſe that are moſt Godly, and moſt Holy, and moſt Gracious. Now there is a great deal of Pride in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:168534:60"/> in going in waies from them that are Holy &amp; Godly in matter of things that are indifferent, and you your ſelves acknowledg it, and yet you muſt have a peculiar Garb by your ſelves, as ſome have a ſingular tone of ſpeech, and an affected gate, and ſtrange kind of faſhion, and a ſullen kind of way of keeping what they have had heretofore many yeers, though there be no body elſe have the ſame thing, yet they think it is humility, when indeed there is a ſullenneſs of Spirit, and a proud ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in it, and wilfulneſs, when they wil go in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent way, even from the way of Godly, Holy, and Gracious Chriſtians, and would have ſomwhat peculiar to themſelves. For any man to affect ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, in things wherein he may lawfully ſuit himſelf with others, this is Pride wherever it is, and eſpecially thoſe that are Godly, they ſhould ſuit themſelves with others wherein they can, becauſe there is ſomething wherein their Conſcience will not give them leave to ſuit with others, being bound in Conſcience, they have not that liberty that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men have to do this or that, to go this way or that way that other men can do, or go in for their own ends: that which they apprehend to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rule, they muſt go on to the utmoſt in every thing, whatever men do that they live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt, but now becauſe in ſome things thou art bound up, having a tender Conſcience, that you muſt go according to the Rule, therefore it ſhould be thy wiſdom in all things wherein thou canſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend, and ſuit thy ſelf with other men lawfully, to do it, becauſe hereby thou ſhalt convince the world that when thou doſt differ from them, it is not out of proud ſingularity, but out of Conſcience, they will think that if thou couldeſt in thy Conſcience ſuit with them thou wouldeſt, becauſe in all things wherein thou canſt thou ſuiteſt with them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:168534:61"/> thoſe that are Chriſtians, ſhould in as much as they can be Servants to every one, that is, yeild to every one, and ſuit themſelves with every one, upon this ground, that they may by this convince al the world that where they are different from other men, it is not out of honor and pride, but meerly out of obedience to Jeſus Chriſt. Thus you have ſeen the behavior of an humble Spirit, in reference to God, in reference to himſelf, and in reference to other men.</p>

                  </gap> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the true excellency of a Lowly heart appears, that we may be in Love with this Grace.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is no grace in Scripture that God ſpeaks more honorably of, that the Lord hath a more honorable eſteem of. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 19. See what the Teſtimony of God is of an humble ſpirit, <hi>Better it is to be of an humble ſpirit with the lowly, than to divide the Spoile with the proude..</hi> Here is Gods Teſtimony, here is two ſortes of people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared one with another, the humble ſpirit, and he that divides the Spoile with the proude, there is no time wherein the heart of man is more lifted up, than when a man hath overcome his enemy, and is triumphing and dividing the ſpoil, Oh, Now his ſpirit is above, Now (ſaith God) you poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:168534:62"/> when you can get victory, and make a prey of your enemies, then your hearts are lifted up, and you think ſuch a man hath a brave conqueſt over his enemy, and now he is triumphing, Well, ſaith God, there is a poor humble contrite heart that the world takes no notice of, and I count it better for one to be of an <hi>Humble Spirit with the Lowly, than to divide the Spoil with the proud.</hi> Take men in their greateſt jollity, and height, and glory, and luſtre, that ever men were in the world, yet the poor humble, Lowly ſpirited men, are more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in mine Eyes, I count a poor S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of an humble and contrite ſpirit,</hi> As if there were no object for the Eye of God to feed upon, to be pleaſed withal but the humble ſpirit, whereas the proud he looks afar off upon them, <hi>Pſalm. 138. 6. Though the Lord be high, yet he hath reſpect unto the Lowly, but the proud he knoweth afar off,</hi> The humble he looks upon; as if God ſhould ſay, there is nothing in all the world that is worth my looking upon but an humble ſpirit yea, and God loves to be neer to them, in <hi>Pſal. 34. 18. The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and ſaveth ſuch as be of a contrite Spirit,</hi> He loves to be neer one that is of an humble ſpirit, Yea, and he loves to dwel with them. In <hi>Iſai. 57. 15. Thus ſaith the high and lofty one, that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is holy, I dwel in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and an humble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> God lifts up himſelf, and ſaith twice, firſt that
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:168534:62"/> he is high and lofty in himſelf, and then that he dwels in the high and lofty place, and yet, faith he, I dwel in an humble ſpirit, it may be an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit is ſuch a one as proud men ſcorn their company, cannot indure their company, Well, but God loves to dwel in the Houſe where thou art, let it be never ſo poor a cottage, he loves to dwel there, God hath but two Houſes, he hath the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Heavens, and the loweſt heart, thoſe are the two Houſes God dwels in, the Heavens above, and the heart that is low, and the lower the heart is, the more the Lord loves to dwel there.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The excellency of an humble ſpirit appears in this, that it is a grace that moſt convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men, even a proud man ſees a luſtre of humility in others, one proud man hates another proud man, whereas one humble man loves another humble man, humility is that that glaires in the Eyes of thoſe that are contrary to it, a proud man, if he ſees one humble is mightily convinced of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it, thoſe are the Chriſtians that live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly, which manifeſt the lowlineſs of their hearts and humility in their carriage.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And further, It is that grace likewiſe whereby one walks worthy of the Goſpel, you may add this if you will to the former, and in that it is convincing. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Epheſ. 4. 1, 2. I therefore the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner of the Lord, beſeech you, that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called, with all low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Meekneſs,</hi> When Lowlineſs of heart ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in your Demean or and Carriage thus, here is walking now worthy of the vocation to which you are called.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Yea and further, It is an evidence of Gods eternal election, and as here Chriſt joynes
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:168534:63"/> Low lineſs and Meekneſs together, ſo in Scripture they are joyned in this, in walking worthy of your calling, and a note of your election, So in <hi>Coloſ. 3. 12. Put on therefore, as the Elect of God, Holy and beloved, Bowels of mercies, Kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind,</hi> It is an Argument that God hath ſet his heart upon thee from al eternity, if he hath given thee a Lowly heart.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, And further, Humility is a Grace that is beyond all kind of Sacrifices acceptable to God, in <hi>Pſal. 51. The Sacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit,</hi> But the place eſpecially that I would fix this upon, it is that in <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 6. and ſo on, There is the queſtion asked, <hi>Wherewith ſhal I come before the Lord, and bow my ſelf before the high God? Shal I come before him with burnt offerings, and Calves of a year Old? Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rams, Or with ten thouſand of Rivers of Oyl? Shall I give my firſt born for my Tranſgreſſion, the fruite of my Body for the ſin of my Soul?</hi> Here was great things, ſhal I do all this? We are willing to do all this, Mark verſe, 8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to Love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> Here is a Scripture that juſtifies what we ſaid before, that an humble man is of a tender heart; but now I note it only for this, that when they ſeem to promiſe ſuch great things to God, that they would offer if they were able thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſand Rivers of Oyl, that they would give the fruite of their body for the ſin of their Soul, ſaith God, all this is nothing to me in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of your walking humbly before me, walk humbly before God, and this is more to God, then if you were able to ſhew your reſpects unto him in offering thouſands of Rams, or ten thouſand Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Oyl, or give the fruite of your body for the
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:168534:63"/> ſin of your Soul. You that are poor people, you are not able to give much to God, you think, Oh, if I were able to do much ſervice for God, to do great things for God as others are, what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing were it? But I have nothing; Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but canſt thou walk humbly before the Lord? It is more then if thou couldeſt give Kingdoms unto God, and therefore a great excellency appears in this Grace of Humility.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, And then humility it is a main ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the prevalency in prayer, God hath a ſpecial Eye to the Humility of the Soul in ſeeking of him in Prayer, I might give you divers Scriptures for that, in 2 <hi>Chron. 7. 14. If my people which are called by my name, ſhal humble themſelves, and ſeek my Face, and pray, I wil hear them ſaith God.</hi> And ſo again in <hi>Pſal. 9. 12. He forgetteth not the cry of the Humble,</hi> If an humble man cry, Oh, it takes deep impreſſion in the heart of God, it will not go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut of his mind for a long time together, as you know ſome things that are ſpoken that take the heart, are not eaſily forgotten, as when you come to a Sermon, if you hear ſomthing that is ſpoken that takes the heart, it will abide with you, it will not eaſily be forgotten, ſo here, he will not forget the cry of the humble, as if he ſhould ſay, Oh, the cry of the humble doth ſo take my heart, that I cannot forget it, it may be ſomtimes when you go abroad, and hear the cries of ſome miſerable people, you cannot forget it, you ſay, O me thinks in the night, and whatever I am about, I hear the cry of ſuch a one, there is the cry of ſuch a poor creature in mine Ears; ſo ſaith God, whatever I am about, me thinks the cry of the humble is in mine Ears, I cannot forget it, and therefore ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 10. 12. Ariſe O Lord, O God lift up thy hand, forget not the
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:168534:64"/> Humble,</hi> He doth not inſtance in any other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication but the humble, do not forget the Humble, the Lord, he can paſs by Kings, and Princes, and great ones, but he will not forget the Humble. As I remember that Famous Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> that wrote the book of Martyrs, when a poor Woman came to beg of him his Prayers, well ſaith he, I may forget Kings and Princes, but I hope I ſhall never forget an humble, broken Soul, this is Gods reſpect to the humble. And then in <hi>Pſal. 10. 17. Lord thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt incline thine Ear to hear.</hi> An humble heart, if he have but a deſire, preſently God hears it; Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble, he doth not ſay, thou haſt heard the Prayer of the humble, but thou haſt heard the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the humble, the very deſire of an humble Soul cries aloud in Gods Ears. And therefore (by the way) of all things in the world take heed of wronging thoſe that are humble, take heed of doing wrong to one that hath a Lowly heart, if ſuch a one that hath a broken heart goes and makes his moan to God, woe unto thee, for no cry takes ſuch migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty impreſſion in Gods heart, as the cry of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if it be twenty years after he will not forget it, ſuch an humble Soul came and made its moan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a Man or Woman, and I remember it; and therefore in theſe times, when ye cal for Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and the Church cals for Prayer, and our own neceſſity calls for Prayer, we had need be of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirits, for this is a maine ingredient for the prevalency of Prayer, and therefore there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in the Grace of humility.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Further, an humble heart is a tryed heart, no man or woman knows their own hearts but thoſe that are humble, thou canſt not know
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:168534:64"/> thine own heart till thou beeſt humble. There is many afraid leſt they ſhould be deceived, they cry out, O my heart is deceitful, and I may deceive my ſelf and perriſh at laſt, wouldeſt thou prevent this? wouldeſt thou not be deceived in the matters of eternity, and thy eternal eſtate? Then be very Lowly and humble, and then thou wilt know thy heart; the reaſon why all <hi>Hipocrites</hi> go away with a formal profeſſion, and do not know their hearts, and have falſneſs lie at the bottom, it is from the pride of their own hearts, becauſe their hearts are not broken, and are not humble, therefore mark what God ſaith in <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. Saith God to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there when he would bring them into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>And thou ſhalt remember al the way which the Lord thy God led thee theſe fourty years in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> What was it for? <hi>For to humble thee, and prove thee, and know what was in thine Heart.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wouldeſt keep his commandements or no, all this was to humble thee, and prove thee, and to know what was in thy heart. Did not God know what was in their heart before? Yes certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but he would have them know what was in their heart, and how would he do it? By humbling them, and proving them, God humbles men by bringing their eſtates Low, and they come to know what is in their hearts thereby, O! men that did proſper in outward things, now in theſe times God hath taken their eſtates from them, and they come to know more what is in their own hearts then before, and in this God doth recompence their loſs of Eſtate, that they come to know their own hearts more, Saith an humble ſoul, true, I have loſt much of mine eſtate, but yet withal I have come thereby to know more of mine own heart then ever I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: then I argue from the leſſer to the greater, if the looſing of a mans eſtate will try one, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:168534:65"/> the humbling of the heart will try one more, that is the excellency of an humble heart, it is a tryed heart, the Lord may truſt ſuch a Soul, let God ſet them about what he will, to do or ſuffer, an humble heart is fit for it.</p>
               <p>Eightly, And then the next thing is this, an humble heart is fit to be imployed in great Services, in any great thing for God, no man or woman is ſo fit to be imployed in great things as thoſe that are humble, God himſelf did a more glorious work in his low eſtate, then in his high eſtate, the work of Redemption is a more glorious work, then the work of creation, and in what a low eſtate was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in redeeming the world? Chriſt in dying, and in being made a curſe, in that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemes the world, and Chriſt never did from all eternity greater things then when he was made a curſe for mans ſin, as he was a God, <hi>Though he thought it no Robbery to be equal with God,</hi> As in <hi>Pillip. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Yet he emptied himſelf as the word is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient unto the death of the Croſs,</hi> I ſay, there is a greater thing done by God there in that low eſtate, then ever was done from all eternity before, And as God doth greater things in his low eſtate, then in his high eſtate, ſo it is with man alſo, he doth greater things in his low eſtate then when he is raiſed high, And hence it is that thoſe great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that God uſed for his honor were kept but low, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> he wandered up and down a long time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and how was he tryed, and humbled? And ſo <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> that God intended to do ſuch great things by, and ſo al the worthies of God, that God made choice inſtruments for his Glory, they muſt firſt be low. And <hi>Paul,</hi> that was the choiceſt inſtrument that ever God had, next to Chriſt, how low was he? in <hi>Acts,</hi> 20. 19. He tels
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:168534:65"/> the elders of <hi>Epheſus, He had ſerved the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many Tears and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,</hi> And God fitted him to be a great inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Glory. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. You have a notable expreſſion of <hi>Paul</hi> for this purpoſe, the latter part of the verſe, <hi>Moſt gladly therefore wil I rather glory in mine infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me, therefore I take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſities, in perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in diſtreſſes for Chriſt ſake, for when I am weak then am I ſtrong, Paul</hi> could Glory in his infirmities, and he ſpeaks of his infirmities that he would take pleaſure in, in reproaches, perſecutions diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake, but now Mark theſe two expreſſions that follow upon this, firſt, <hi>That the power of Chriſt might reſt upon him,</hi> The power of Jeſus Chriſt reſts upon <hi>Paul</hi> when he was brought into a low eſtate, and when he could humbly ſubmit himſelf ſo far to the hand of God, as to rejoyce in his infirmities, <hi>Paul</hi> could never do ſuch great things for God as then. And then again, Saith he, <hi>When I am weak, then am I ſtrongeſt,</hi> Oh, Humility is that that makes the Soul fit for any Service for God, though humble men may lie hid for a while and be as it were under the hatches for it, yet certainly. God intends great things for humble Hearts, and what he doth not now, he will reſerve for them hereafter, and make them inſtruments of his Glory in a more ſpecial manner, but at one time or other every humble ſoul ſhal be a glorious inſtrument of the praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, this we may boldly affirme. You will ſay, they may live obſcurely and die. I grant it, but then God hath another time to make them glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inſtruments of his praiſes hereafter, and to ſhew forth himſelf in Glory upon them to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence what Glory they were willing to deny here in this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and willing to be deprived of as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the will of God.</p>
               <pb n="596" facs="tcp:168534:66"/>
               <p>Ninthly: Further, Humility hath this excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in it, That it is that that puts an ornament upon al Graces, it is as it were the Luſtre, Beauty, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, the Varniſh, Nay that is too mean a Phraſe, it is the Glory and true Beauty of every Grace in a man. I remember <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> hath ſuch an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as this, <hi>Whatever a man doth without Humility, though he ſhould work Miracles, he were but as a dead Dog,</hi> Let a man do never ſo much, yet there is no Beauty in what he doth where there is no humility, but Humility puts an Ornament and Beauty upon all Graces. That place is known in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5. we have often had occaſion to make uſe of it, <hi>Be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with Humility,</hi> I have told you ſomtimes, the propriety of the word ſignifies, the dreſſing with Ribbons, fine beautiful Ornaments, <hi>Be clothed with Humility,</hi> it is the beautiful ornament of a Chriſtian, and of al the Graces of a Chriſtian, it puts off Grace, and every action with a Grace, as I may ſo ſay, And that ſome think to be the meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that we ſhall ſpeak unto afterwards, In 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 5. God reſiſteth the Proud and giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi> It is true, (as we ſhall ſhew afterwards) that God gives Grace, that is, the Graces of his Spirit, but there is a further ſence in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God gives a Grace to that, God puts a Beauty and Ornament upon the Humble, for Humility doth ſo beautifie a Chriſtian, that whatever they do they do it with a Grace, there is no Chriſtian that doth things with ſuch a Grace as the Humble, and it is that that doth adorn all Graces, Humility Graceth all Graces whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Tenthly: And then it is that that preſerves all Graces too, and ſo ſome take the word there to come from a word that ſignifies a knot, becauſe it ties all Graces, as it were, with faſt knots together,
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:168534:66"/> as I find ſome Interpreters carry the word, it unites, and knits, and ſtrengthens all Graces, <hi>Paul</hi> walked humbly with God, walked conſtantly with him, whatever fell out, it did not hinder them from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, As in <hi>Acts</hi> 20, the place I named before, when he called together the Elders of Epheſus at verſe 19. when they were come, he ſpeaks to them thus, <hi>Serving the Lord with all Humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews,</hi> whatever temptations did befall <hi>Paul,</hi> yet he was able to go through them, for he ſerved the Lord with all Humility, it is the proud ſwollen heart that is the backſliding heart, but the humble heart is the heart that keeps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with God, it preſerves all the Graces of the Spirit of God in vigor, and in ſtrength, uniting of them together, and uniting the Soul to the Fountain of all Grace, it is the preſervative of all Grace.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly: And again, Humility it is that that makes all Duties and all Afflictions to be eaſie, therefore this follows that I ſhall ſpeak to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Learn of me and be lowly in heart,</hi> and then <hi>My Yoak is eaſie and my Burden is light,</hi> it is an eaſie thing for a man to do any thing that God ſets him about if he be once humble, there is no difficulty that a man finds in the ſervice of God but it is through pride of heart. And ſo there is an eaſe in all Afflictions in being humble, that that yeilds you know can bear oppoſition without any great noiſe, indeed the tall Cedars are broken with winds, but the poor ſhrubs below they do not ſuffer ſo much, but theſe two will fall more ſeaſonably in when we come to ſhew how humility gives quiet and reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly: Again, There is nothing that makes
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:168534:67"/> the life of a man and woman more joyful, and more comfortable, than Humility: You think the proud have the jolly lives, and the comfortable lives, No, but the humble have moſt comfortableneſs, becauſe it makes them to prize the leaſt mercy. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> upon <hi>Acts</hi> 7. hath this expreſſion. <hi>None ſaith he, live ſo comfortably as the humble,</hi> and he gives the reaſon for it, <hi>Becauſe the leaſt thing he enjoyes, he ſets ſuch a price upon the mercy, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in it,</hi> you ſhall obſerve it, come to a poor Godly Family, and you hear nothing but bleſſing and praiſing of Gods mercy, and wondring at Gods mercy, you that have great Houſes, and great Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles furniſhed, you are wrangling and ſnarling at this and the other thing, but an humble heart is praiſing and bleſſing God for his mercy and enjoy more of the mercies of Gods that they have than you do in all your abundance. If a man have his fleſh ſwollen, he will not be able to bear it, but it will be mighty toubleſome to him: So when the heart is ſwollen it will bring trouble to thee, but this likewiſe will come more fully in, when we come to ſpeak of the Promiſe, <hi>I will give you reſt.</hi> But now there is only one thing more for opening the excellency of this Grace, and that is, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious Promiſes in Scripture that are made to humble hearts, as now to name a few, <hi>That God will guide the humble in their way,</hi> Pſal. 25. 9. I confeſs your Books have it <hi>Meek,</hi> and ſo I made uſe of it in opening Meekneſs, but the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, <hi>Humble,</hi> and you may take it both waies, and therefore in <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 2. you have an excellent Scripture there. <hi>With the Lowly there is Wiſdom,</hi> No man or woman hath that Wiſdom for the guiding and governing of their waies, as the Lowly; Proud men will run on upon their own heads raſhly, becauſe they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of their own waies, but the Lowly will
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:168534:67"/> examin, and wait, and ſuſpect themſelves, they wil try and examin their waies, and go in an humble way, <hi>With the Lowly there is Wiſdom.</hi> Oh! into what Labyrinths, ſtraits, aed extremities, do proud people hurry themſelves, but now the Lowly they have the guidance of the Spirit of God carrying them on in their way, and therefore they can quiet their hearts, and liſten to know what the mind of God is. And another Promiſe is, <hi>That God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Humble,</hi> the humble is ready to be trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, but in <hi>Iſay 57. 15. The Lord ſaith, he will revive the humble.</hi> And another is that in <hi>Peter He will give Grace to the Humble.</hi> And that ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that you have in <hi>Prov. 3.

Are you thankful for what you have? An humble heart will take notice of every little it hath &amp; wait upon God for more. Make uſe of this Promiſe, true Lord, I have not ſuch Grace as I would have, but I have my heart ſubdued to this condition, then here is the Promiſe, <hi>The Lord will give Grace to the Humble.</hi> And then there is the Promiſe of Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 33. and <hi>Math. 23. 12.

What God did in Heaven? he gives this Anſwer, He is beating down the Proud, and lifting up the Humble, that is the thing that he is doing in Heaven; and therefore thoſe in Scripture that have been loweſt, you ſee how afterwards God hath exalted them. <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God, and he ſhall exalt you in due time,</hi> in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 6. ſpeaking there of Humility, there is but one word in the Greek there for due time, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the opportunity of time, God will
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:168534:68"/> exalt you when a fit opportunity comes. And then there is the Promiſe of ſafety alſo to the humble, in <hi>Job</hi> 22. 29. God makes a Promiſe there to keep thoſe that are humble in a ſafe condition, whatever dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is abroad, the Lord will preſerve them, <hi>When men are caſt down, then thou ſhalt ſay there is a lifting up, and he ſhall ſave the humble Perſon,</hi> the Lord wil ſave the humble Perſon in time of trouble, <hi>He ſhall find mercy frrom God in troubleſom times.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Zeph. 3. 12. I will alſo leave in the midſt of thee, an afflicted and poor People, and they ſhal truſt in the name of the Lord,</hi> it is ſpoke of the times of Captivity, and great miſery, that People ſhould be in times of trouble.</p>
               <p>Yea, All outward needfull things is promiſed to the humble, in <hi>Prov. 22. 4. By Humility and the fear of the Lord is Riches, and Honor, and Life.</hi> You wil ſay, Humble people (may be) are poor, but they have more aſſurance of Riches than any in the world have, they have Gods bond for Riches, but ſtill ever to be underſtood with the condition of the Croſs, ever underſtood ſo, as may be uſefull for the enriching of their Souls, God hath promiſed to enrich their outward eſtates. You think by the pride of your hearts, and your buſſeling in the world, you may get much, but by walking hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with God, you may expect more bleſſing upon your eſtate than from any thing in the world.</p>
               <p>But now that which is the main Promiſe of all, is, that in the Text, <hi>Learn of me for I am Meek and Lowly in heart and you ſhall find reſt for your Souls,</hi> and there are no People in the world that have ſo much reſt in their hearts, ſuch ſatisfaction in their Souls, as thoſe that are of humble hearts, there is a great deal of diſquiet in the world and men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

Would not any of you have this Promiſe fulfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>led in ſuch troubleſome times as this, when there is no reſt in any thing in the world? Here is that Scripture that will ſhew that though you cannot have reſt in any thing in the world, yet you ſhall have reſt in your Souls, it was in the former verſe, when Chriſt did invite poor <hi>laden Sinners to come to him, I will give you reſt,</hi> there is the reſt of the Goſpel that comes to the ſoul by Jeſus Chriſt, I do not intend to look back to thoſe things, all that I intend in this Promiſe is, to ſhew you how Humility brings reſt unto the Soul (I have ſhewed before how Meekneſs brings reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul,) and then we ſhall come to the words following, the eaſineſs of the Yoke of Jeſus Chriſt to thoſe that are thus lowly as Chriſt would have them to be.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly: Humility is an excellent Grace, next unto that Grace that the Scripture makes to be the condition of the new Covenant, Faith it is that Grace that is moſt uſeful and neceſſary to give God the Glory of the new Covenant, and that upon this ground: For God though he did intend Salvation to ſome wretched and unworthy Creatures, yet he hath ſo wrought in his Wiſdom, that he will ſave them in ſuch a way as he ſhall have all the Glory and the Creature ſhall be debaſed as much as can be. We cannot think how an infinite Wiſdome could find out a way to ſave mankind, and
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:168534:69"/> that in a way of Covenant too, to ſave loſt man in a way of a Covenant, wherein man that is ſaved ſhould be debaſed, and the name of God ſo much honored as that way is that God hath done in the Covenant of Grace, for it is this. God will ſave them in the way of a Covenant, a Covenant you wil ſay, that is ſomwhat, it is true, God will require ſomwhat of man in the Covenant, I but yet in that manner, as man is as much debaſed as poſſibly can be, for the condition is ſo, as man muſt be emptied of al, be nothing in himſelf, he muſt go wholly out of himſelf for a principle of life, yea, and when he hath it, he muſt live upon that that is out of himſelf, for ſo a Chriſtian muſt do, not only go firſt in Jeſus Chriſt for a principle of life there, but this principle of life muſt depend upon Chriſt, it cannot be with man now as it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> God gave <hi>Adam</hi> Grace and he was to live upon that ſtock, but now we have grace from Chriſt, and we cannot live upon that ſtock but we muſt ſtill live upon him, ſtill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the life that is in him: So that man is the moſt emptied, and debaſed, in that way that God hath appointed to ſave him by, he muſt deny himſelf in the greateſt manner that a Creature can be put to. We think this is a great deal of ſelf deniall, for a man to be willing to be mean in the world, and to ſuffer much in the world for Chriſt, it is a great deal of ſelf deniall I confeſs: but when the Soul goes to Chriſt in the way of Faith, in the Covenant of Grace, there is the greateſt ſelf deniall of all, for there a man doth not only deny his outward comforts here for the preſent, but he denies his own Righteouſneſs, his own abilities, his own gifts, yea, and afterwards when he comes to have Graces, he denies them too, and wholly goes out of himſelf for juſtification, and reconciliation with God, and all thoſe things that are excellent in their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:168534:69"/> he doth look upon as Droſs and Dung in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what he finds in Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that Faith is that that carries with it as great a ſelf denial as we can conceive a Creature is capable of in this world, Faith makes one like Chriſt in that reſpect, Chriſt, though he was glorious, yet he did empty himſelf, Faith makes one empty ones ſelf of all that is good, and therefore of all Graces, humility is the moſt ſubſervient and helpful to Faith, and pride is the greateſt enemy to Faith, and eſpecially pride in thoſe things that a man counts his greateſt excellency, ſome men indeed have a pride in their Cloaths, and others in their Eſtates, theſe are but poor things, but when a man comes to have pride in his Duties, and graces, this is the pride of heart that is an enemy to Faith, And therefore that place is very obſeruable, in the Prophecy of <hi>Habakkuck,</hi> How living by Faith, and pride are oppoſed to one Another. In <hi>Habakkuck, 2. 4. Behold his Soul which is lifted up is not upright in him, but the juſt ſhall live by his Faith,</hi> This Text will ſerve both for this I now bring it for, and to confirme another thing that I ſpake of even now, that is, how humility preſerves Grace, and keeps men and women from being Apoſtates, It is apparent here, ſaith he, <hi>Behold his Soul which is lifted up is not upright, in time of trouble</hi> He will fal off, <hi>But the juſt ſhal live by his Faith,</hi> It is all one, where there is no pride, there is humility, where the heart is emptyed of pride, there the heart is fit to beleeve, and that is the Reaſon why many poor Souls are ſo long under the Spirit of bondage, becauſe God would be weakening the pride of their hearts. You think that a poor Soul that hath horror and trouble of conſcience hath little pride in him, one that is ready to deſpair, and to conclude of it ſelf that it ſhall go to Hell, is that Soul proude? Certainly, there is a great deal of pride in it then, you will ſay, how will that appear that it is pride? Becauſe it would fain find ſomwhat in it ſelf
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:168534:70"/> to preſent unto God for its mercy, though it do not think to merit, yet it would preſent ſomthing to God for its mercy, and here is pride, the heart hath not denied it ſelf thus as to venture it ſelf upon Chriſt, though it have nothing to preſent to God, it is not brought to this, to go to Jeſus Chriſt as a meer beggar that hath nothing to live upon; now becauſe the Soul is not brought to this, therefore it is that the Soul is many months and years without comfort, the Lord hath not humbled and emptied the Soul yet, but now, when the Lord comes to empty the Soul, perhaps by the work of his Spirit, though not by Gods Sanctifying Grace, though there is not a Sanctifying principle put into the Soul, yet it is that that is very like it, and it is that whereby the Soul doth act by, as it doth when a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Sanctification is put into it, but this Grace is very uſeful, for that is one ſpecial aime that God hath in the Covenant of grace, though he wil glorifie his creature, yet he wil debaſe it in ſuch a way that the Creature ſhal have nothing to boaſt of, what ſhould we <hi>Boaſt of?</hi> Saith <hi>Paul, if it were of works, then we might boaſt, but becauſe it is of Faith we have nothing to boaſt of.</hi> Thus much for the Excellency of the grace of Humility.</p>

                  <p>Humility brings Reſt unto the Soul in Eight Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, 1. It ventures upon nothing before it ſees Gods call. 2.

                     </gap> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Heart yeild to it. 6. It makes the Heart rejoyce in the property of others. 7. It is under many promiſes. 8. All Croſſes are ſmal to an Humble Heart.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt now we come to open the promiſe, and then we will apply altogether, the promiſe here made to thoſe that are lowly in Heart, <hi>I will give you Reſt.</hi> Now I ſhal not need to open the Reſt that a Chriſtians heart hath that comes to Chriſt, that hath been done at large in the former verſe, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy Laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> Therefore here I ſhall only ſhew, how Humility, and Lowlineſs of heart gives <hi>Reſt unto the Soul,</hi> There is, I confeſs, a great correſpondency between thoſe two Graces, and therefore I ſhal ſpeak the leſs now of the Reſt of the Soul in humility, becauſe there is a great affinity between this and Meekneſs, now one that is Lowly in heart muſt needs live at Reſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe ſuch a one dares not venture upon any thing before he ſees Gods cal, a bold ſpirit will venture upon any thing when he hath not Gods cal, and there he meets with trouble, but now a Lowly Spirit thinks
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:168534:71"/> thus, is this Gods way? Have I a word for it? And a cal for it? <hi>If I have,</hi> Let me go on whatever comes of it, if he meet with trouble in ſuch a buſineſs, if he can ſay, I undertook it thus, I had Gods cal, what abundance of Reſt hath he? What is the Reaſon that men are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted in the world, and troubled? It is becauſe they ruſh upon things without Gods cal. When the Soul can appeal to God, Lord, I would not undertake ſuch a thing, nor ſuch a thing, though I ſay, there might be ſome preferment by it, and ſomewhat got by it, yet, Lord, thou ſeeſt the uprightneſs of my heart, that I would not venture upon it without thy cal, and then when I ſaw that, I ventured upon it, ſuch a Soul muſt needs have a great deal of quiet.</p>
               <p>Secondly, One that is humble hath Reſt becauſe he can never be in ſo low a condition, but his heart is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer then his condition. This is an excellent frame of Spirit, though my Eſtate is low, yet my heart is lower, if you be able to ſay ſo, you that have low Eſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your care is how you can raiſe your Eſtates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I could raiſe my Eſtate as high as others. Then I ſhould have a great deal of Peace and comfort, No, thy way muſt be to lowen thy Heart, that is the way to raiſe thy Eſtate. If a mans affliction be above his Heart, and his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the affliction, if the fire he under the fewel then the fire quickly catcheth the fewel, but now if the Fire be above the fewel, it will not ſo ſoon kinkle it, ſo I ſay in a mans affliction, if a mans heart be above his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I mean in a ſinful way, he hath lifted up his heart, and he would have higher things then theſe things are, and theſe things are beneath his ſpirit, he hath a higher deſign and plot, and aimes at greater things, and theſe things are beneath what he would have, Oh! Then the affliction troubles the Spirit, but when a mans ſpirit is beneath his afflictions then a man hath a great deal of Reſt and quiet, he is lower then his afflictions and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is quiet.</p>
               <pb n="607" facs="tcp:168534:71"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Another thing in the Lowlineſs of heart that doth bring quietneſs, and hath affinity with it, is this: One that is Lowly in heart, hath never any diſappointments in the world; nothing is more troubleſome, and diſquieting to a mans ſpirit then diſappointment, now one that is Lowly in Heart, he expects no great matters in this world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he cannot be much diſappointed in any thing that befals, and ſo he is quiet; you that have great plots and deſignes in your heads and make account of great things in the world, there will follow many Croſſes that wil diſappoint you, and how do they diſquiet you, you may account of ſuch a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and when it is loſt, how unquiet are you? Whereas one that is Lowly in heart, he is quiet, and goes on in obedience to God, and that is that he looks to moſt, to go on in his calling in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and leaves the iſſue to God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there be any thing coming in, he receives it thankfully, becauſe he is moſt unworthy, if he be croſſed he is not much diſappointed, becauſe he looks for no high things.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, An humble heart muſt needs bring Reſt, becauſe this is the guiſe and frame of it, it would have God to have his glory his own way; and this one principle, Oh, What abundance of quiet, and Reſt would it bring to a mans ſpirit. That God ſhould have his Glory, we all yeild to that, I but that God ſhould be glorified in his own way, this is hard, now let this and the other fal out, I but yet, ſaith a Lowly heart, it is fit God ſhould have his Glory which way he pleaſeth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not troubled.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Humility brings a great deal of quiet, becauſe it freeth us from oppoſition, or if it come,
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:168534:72"/> it makes us yeild to the oppoſition, it freeth us from oppoſition of men, for ſo I told you in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, an humble heart is afraid to give any offence, and ſo it is not likely that others will offend him, but if oppoſition do come, a Lowly heart yeilds to it, and when there is a yeilding in time of oppoſition, when a bluſtring wind comes, yet if there be a yeilding to it, it doth no great hurt, and ſo the heart that yeilds to oppoſition it hath quiet and Reſt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Humility brings a great deal of quiet, becauſe it makes us rejoyce in the proſperity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the great trouble and diſquiet of the ſpirits of men in the world is, that others are above them, now an humble heart bleſſeth God that any are above it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, An humble heart is under a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of promiſes, and there muſt needs be Reſt and quiet to that Soul.</p>
               <p>Eightly, All croſſes are ſmal to an humble Soul, becauſe he is ſmal in his own Eyes, according to what proportion a man bears to his own Eye, ſo his croſſes are, if his Croſſes be great in his own eye, then they are great croſſes to him, and therefore you account your afflictions great, if you account your affliction in your own Eye, I but now, if you were ſmal in your own Eyes, you would count your afflictions ſmaller. But we cannot open the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of theſe, except we go further in the opening of the Grace of humility, and therefore as ever you would have Reſt and quiet in theſe troubleſome and reſtleſs times, labor for humble and quiet ſpirits.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Exhortation to humility with five ſeveral means to get it. 1. Labor to ſee the Excellency of it. 2. Convince the Soul of its emptineſs. 3. Get the knowledg of God. 4. Of Chriſt. 5. Of our ſelves.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOw then we come to the Uſe and Application, ſome time might be ſpent in ſpeaking about Examination, to ſhew whether we are humble or not, and then to ſhew the difference between being humble, and humbled, many are humbled by affliction, brought low, or by Terror Tormented, but their hearts are not humble, there is a great deal of difference between Humiliation and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, but I ſhal refer that as a ſeaſonable point to be handled at another time, Certainly God hath made many people to be humbled, and yet not humble in their Spirits.</p>
               <p>And then another uſe may be, to humble our Souls for the want of humility, and indeed that is a good Humiliation, to be humble for the want of humility, to be humbled for our pride is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth of humility as much as any thing whatſoever, and certainly, if I ſhould go back and open the Particulars of the behavior of an humble Soul towards God, its ſelf, and others, Certainly, never a Man and Woman but may lay his hand upon
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:168534:73"/> his Mouth, and ſay, Lord, have mercy upon me, how have I failed in the behavior of my ſpirit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, my ſelf, and others? Lord, my heart hath not anſwered to that that hath been ſpoken in the word, the truth is, the beſt of us all have cauſe to be humbled before God becauſe they are not humble as they ought. To be proud of heart, one compares it to an Onion, that if you pill off one part of it, there is another pil afterwards, pill off that and there is another ſtill, and another, and another til you come to the end; ſo when there is ſome pride, take off one, and under that pride there lies more, take off that, and under it there lies more, and take off that, and under it lies more, continually more and more pride there lies in the heart of Men, and Women, and that man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that thinks they have not proud hearts, I dare challenge them, in the Name of God, that they have proud hearts, As <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>John,</hi> 1. and laſt verſ. <hi>If we ſay we have not ſin, we Lie,</hi> ſo if we ſay we have not pride, it is an evident Argument we Lie, and it is an evident Argument we have pride. Pride is like the Garment, the firſt that is put on, and the laſt that is put off, and it is that that the heart ſticks more in then any thing elſe, and therefore Chriſt ſaith of his Diſciples that were humbled, they denyed al for Chriſt, and yet mark what Chriſt ſaith concerning them, In <hi>Matth. 18. There they inquired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſhould be greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven. Jeſus takes a little Child, and ſets him in the midſt of them, and ſaith, Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye ſhal not enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Now, were not they become as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Had not they humility? They were graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and godly, I, but this is true of one that is gracious, and humble, he hath a great deal of pride
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:168534:73"/> ſtil, and he had need be converted, and become as little Children, to be humbled more and more. It is an excellent frame of Spirit that we read of in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he had an humble Spirit, and yet <hi>lifted</hi> up in Pride, yet mark what the Text ſaith, in 2 <hi>Chron. 32. 25. 26. Notwithſtanding</hi> Hezekiah <hi>humbled himſelf for the Pride of his heart,</hi> it is ſaid in ver. 25. <hi>But</hi> Hezekiah <hi>rendred not according to the benefit done to him, for his heart was lifted up,</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Hezekiah humbled himſelf for the Pride of his heart.</hi> It is true, the beſt of all have Pride in their hearts: But can you ſay, I have humbled my ſelf for the Pride of my heart? that you are jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of your own hearts? You are afraid of the Pride of your hearts, and you watch over your hearts, that upon the firſt ſtirring of your heart, you labor to keep it down, that you find your heart humbled for your Pride? if you have this, you have that that an Hypocrite hath not the leaſt of, either to be jealous, over his heart, or to keep down his heart, or to watch over his heart, or to obſerve the ſtirrings of his heart: An Hypocrite hath not the leaſt of this. Now if you find this, perhaps you find temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation prevails with you to commit a great ſin, for that you are humble; and to neglect your Duty, for that you are humble, I but are you humbled for the Pride of your own hearts? when you can charge your Souls for the Pride of your hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and your Soul, when you can ſearch your heart, and find it out, and go &amp; lament it in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of your heart, this is a good ſign. Perhaps when the pride of your heart breaks out, and ſhames you before men, for that you are humbled, but when you can be humbled for the firſt ſtirring of your heart towards pride, here is a ſign of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But this I ſhall not ſtand upon, becauſe I will take occaſion to handle this ſin, and ſhew the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:168534:74"/> of this ſin more largely, and therefore all I wil now do ſhall be, to work this upon your hearts, that you may become the Schollars of Chriſt, to be lowly as Chriſt was.</p>
               <p>It is a Uſe of Exhortation, That we would all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for Lowlineſs of heart: Know, it is that that is neceſſary for us, all that we do elſe is nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we come to learn this of Chriſt we learn no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him, you cannot be ſaid to be a Chriſtian, whatever your profeſſion is, all your brave Duties, and performances are nothing. I remember <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion, ſaith he, <hi>If a man be able to raiſe the dead, cure the Lame, cleanſe the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yet if he be not humble he is the moſt filthy thing in the world,</hi> this is the Grace that we have conſtant need of upon every occaſion, in what ſtate ſoever. Doth God afflict you? then you have a great deal of need of this Grace to bear your affliction patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you be lifted up, then you have need of this Grace to carry your ſelf ſo, as you be not raiſed up againſt God, Oh! that you would have care of that, when you find God coming in moſt upon you, that is the time to keep your heart down moſt. As we read of the Devill to Chriſt, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. After Chriſt had that Teſtimony from Heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, and the Spirit of God came upon him like a Dove,</hi> the next words in the beginning of Chap. 4. is. <hi>Then was Jeſus led by the Spirit into the wilderneſs to be tempted by the Devil,</hi> juſt then; thus it is with Chriſtians as it was with Chriſt, ſomtimes in Duties, in Prayer, they are mightily enlarged, and have mighty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and God comes in abundantly unto them, and doth even as it were ſay, this is my beloved Son, and my beloved Daughter, I have choſen you to life, but expect the very next thing will be, the Devill wil take and ſet thee upon a Pinacle of the
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:168534:74"/> Temple to tempt thee, and tempt thee eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Pride. If God imploy you in any great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, then you have need of Humility, it was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Chriſts publick work of his Miniſtry that the Devill came to tempt him, then the Devill fell upon him: So if God imploy a man in publick ſervice, Oh! then the Devil will fall upon him, and tempt him moſt of all then. I remember <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> when God began to work upon him, and he appeared to ſtand up in witneſſing for God, it was one ſpecial Prayer of his, Oh, that God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from Pride, and thoſe that God imploies in publick works had need to pray for this. If God take a man off from any ſervice, he had need have much humility then; and ſo I might inſtance in al kinds of things, that Humility muſt have an ingredient in them. I remember <hi>Bernard</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion, <hi>That except it doth come before, and accompany, and follow, Pride doth extort all out of our hands, and ſpoil all,</hi> Humility is to come before any thing you do, to accompany any thing you do, and it is to follow any thing you do or elſe all is ſpoiled</p>
               <p>And in this Exhortation conſider, that you cannot come all of you to be eminent do what you can, you that are weak do all what you can, you ſhall never come to have any great parts, you cannot have great Eſtates do what you can, but it is poſſible for you to come to be humble. You would think it a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you that are weak, if one could ſhew you how you ſhould come to have excellent parts, gifts, memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp; the like; &amp; you that are poor to be rich &amp; emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the place where you live, &amp; to be above others; Now God will not grant you theſe things, but here I can ſhew you how you can come to be as humble as any man, and that is as much as if God gave you Ships, and they brought home to you the Riches of the Indies, you may come all to be humble, though
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:168534:75"/> you cannot come all to be eminent in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> You wil ſay. <hi>How ſhal we come to get an humble heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt: Labor to ſet the excellency of this Grace before your Souls ſet this Grace in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of it much before you, and meditate on the beauty and excellency of this Grace of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo as to account your excellency to be in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, that which a man accounts his excellency to be in, he is in a good forwardneſs to get it eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in morals. Look upon Humility as your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, as a glorious beautifull Grace, and ſet it before your Soul as that that hath a great deal of beauty and excellency in it, to be in love with this Grace. As ſin prevails in the heart by meditation, a corrupt heart by meditating and plotting about a corruption or ſinfull diſtemper, comes to defile it ſelf with that corruption: So a gracious heart by meditation of the ſweetneſs and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of a Grace, comes to be adornd with that Grace: How comes it that men fall into wickedneſs and ſin, but at firſt this is the beginning of it, they by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſuck out the ſweetneſs of ſin into their Souls, and look upon it as that which they may get ſo much good by, now by delighting in the thoughts of a ſin, they come to fall into a ſin, therefore take heed of delighting in the thoughts of ſin, it is the way to come to fal into a ſin: So by delighting of our ſelves in the meditation of the excellency of Grace, we may come to have that Grace.</p>
               <p>Secondly: Labor to convince thy Soul of the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and vanity of all thoſe outward excellencies that are the uſuall things that puff up the heart; it is nothing but wind that puffs up any mans heart, if they had what is truly excellent their hearts would not be puffed up, but that that puffs up the heart is
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:168534:75"/> wind, Now conſider all things in the world under theſe three Notions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are things beneath the true excellency of an immortall Soul, the way to cure ſinful pride, is to have a holy, gracious pride; Now a Holy pride is to know what is the end of a rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what he is capable of, to enjoy communion with Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the knowledge of this will take off the heart from all things below, look upon theſe things as Dogs meat, if you could but take off your heart from al theſe things it would keep your hearts Low.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Notion is this, Conſider, That al theſe outward Excellencies make no great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, it may be you have more parts than another, you have more Eſtate than another, you have more honor and eſteem than another, What great difference makes this between man and man? But now Grace makes a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man &amp; man, one hath Grace another hath not, this makes a mighty difference; one hath Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; another not, this makes a very great difference, there is not ſo much difference between the natural excellency of an Angell of Heaven and a Worm upon the earth, as between an humble Soul and the greateſt Prince in the world that hath not the Grace of Humility, Were we but throughly principled in this one thing, we may hear it, and confes it I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but none of you when you go away will ſay this is true, that Grace makes the great difference, except you be principled in this thing, that it is not the having much and little that makes any great difference between man and man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: Seriouſly work upon your hearts the meditation of the vanity of all theſe things, how quickly all the beauty and excellency of theſe
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:168534:76"/> things will be gone; what is become of all the great pomp and excellency of the world, when death comes, what is the difference between one that was poor and contemptible, and one that was rich and honorable? Death makes all even, The Glory of the world paſſeth away, and the luſtre of of it, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing here is but as fleſh and graſs that withereth, by looking upon all theſe things that puff up the heart to be but as wind, is the main thing to make the ſoul humble.</p>
               <p>But the main thing is the ſetting God before us, and Chriſt before us, and the right underſtanding of our ſelves, theſe are the three principall things that are helps for the Lowlineſs of the heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The knowledg of God, and the ſetting God before us, is a principal thing to make us humble, you know how it was with him, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. and the beginning, <hi>The man ſpake unto</hi> Ithiel <hi>and</hi> Ucal, I have opened the meaning of this to you at another time, <hi>he ſpake to</hi> Ithiel, God with me, <hi>Surely, I am more brutiſh than any man, and have not the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a man,</hi> Oh! how low was he in his own eyes when he had to deal with God, the ſight of God is that that humbles one more than any thing in the world. And ſo that of <hi>Job,</hi> that famous place in <hi>Job</hi> 42. after God had made himſelf known to <hi>Job</hi> at verſe 3, 4. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but now mine eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor my ſelf and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> What an humble heart, and a broken heart had he? I ſet alwaies God before me. And ſo <hi>Iſay</hi> when he had the viſion of God, and the Seraphims cry <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Holy, Holy, the whol earth is full of thy Glory, wo to me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am undone, becauſe he had ſeen God.</hi> Thus al the Servants of God that did converſe much with God, were very humble, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:168534:76"/> that had a lowly heart, he converſing much with God, and knowing ſo much of the divine nature, having ſuch intereſt in him, therefore there was never ſuch an example of a Lowly Spirit as Chriſts example was, whenas we come to know God, the infinite diſtance that is between God and us, then what is all the excellencies in the world, when thou comeſt to know the infinite excellency of God? What is the glimerings of a Glo-worm when we come to ſee all the Glory of Heaven?</p>
               <p>And then alſo, we come to ſee the infinite depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance we have upon God, I wonder not to ſee men in the world that do not know God, to have bold and preſumptuous Spirits, and ſee men that have knowledg, that they are humble, though the others have their ſpirits lifted up in vanity: But for the ſoul that ever had any ſight of God, it is a wonder that ſuch a Soul ſhould have any riſing of Spirit, that any ſinfull height of Spirit ſhould be in that Soul that knows what an infinite God it hath to deal with. Oh, converſe much with God, and then you will have humble Souls, that Soul that never goes from Duty but hath much converſe with God, that Soul is very humble, As <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord I never go from thee without thee, I carry thee out in my heart when I am in thy preſence.</hi> Now an Hypocrite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeth not with God, you that converſe with men, you would be higher than your Neighbors, and live better than your Neighbors, O! this is the fruit of converſe with men, but now true Humility comes from converſe with God, nothing hath that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in it as that which comes from converſing with God, and upon the ſight of his excellency. May be God laies affliction upon you, takes away a Child, or ſome of your Eſtate, and this (may be) may humble you, but true humility comes from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:168534:77"/> with God and the ſight of his excellency.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another is from the right knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith he, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in heart:</hi> There is no ſuch means of Humility, as converſing much with Chriſt, for there was never ſuch an example of Humility as Chriſt, and it was one of Gods ends to ſend his Son for an example in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, to honor this Grace of Humility, and therefore they that know Chriſt much, and the way of Salvation, cannot but have empty hearts. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin;</hi> ſaith he, <hi>It may be thou wilt be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to imitate an humble man, ſuch a one as is humble to make him thy pattern, thou thinkeſt thou haſt more excellency in thee than him: I, but be not aſhamed to imitate an humble God.</hi> Do but conſider how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Chriſt was to have that Glory and excellency of his to be eclipſed and darkned for ſo many yeers, though he was one that the Angels adored, and he might have let out that Glory to have filled all the whol world, and have made the world aſtoniſhed with his Luſtre, yet he was content for thirty two or thirty three yeers together to go up and down in the world as a man without form and comelineſs, to be deſpiſed, contemned, and ſpit upon. If you have a little excellency, you ſhew it preſently, in Cloaths, in Speeches, and the like, Chriſt ſhewes you by this what vanity this is, what an excellency and Glory was upon him, and yet he was up and down in the world without form and comlineſs.</p>
               <p>And when we look upon Chriſt: Conſider that he was not only humble, but humble for us, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for thy ſin, without which thou muſt have gone to Hell eternally; to be humble for thy ſin, there lies the power and efficacy of Chriſts exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in Chriſts example thou ſeeſt what a mean thing any outward excellency of the world is,
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:168534:77"/> What did he care for any outward excellency? When they would have made him a King, he cared not for it; look up higher, God hath made man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind for higher things than theſe below, I that had the divine nature hypoſtatically joyned to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, I that was one that God intended to make uſe of for the greateſt purpoſes that ever he did in the world, I did not enjoy the world, I had no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in the world, I had no honor nor eſteem among men, I had no riches, no hole to hide my head, and yet I have that that hath more excellency than all the things in the world, and therefore, Children of men you may ſee by this, that God intends humane nature for higher things than theſe below; and therefore it ſhould humble thee that the Son of God ſhould be ſo low, and thou ſo lifted up.</p>
               <p>And for this example, take this one thing that is of great uſe to help us to lowlineſs of heart; Do but conſider the way of God towards Jeſus Chriſt, and how Jeſus Chriſt ſubmitted himſelf unto the way of God towards him, as in this one thing eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; when God manifeſted himſelf in the fulleſt way to him, yet Jeſus Chriſt preſently comes into a low condition, as in that famous example in <hi>Math.</hi> 3. 4. when God manifeſted ſo much of his Glory, then preſently Jeſus Chriſt was content to be low, to come down. And I will give you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="620" facs="tcp:168534:78"/> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>talked with him, and his Diſciples being afraid, he comes to them at the</hi> 7. verſe, <hi>and ſaid, ariſe and be not afraid, and when they had lift<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And there you ſhall find, that when Chriſt was in an Agony, and when he was in trouble of Spirit, then in his Agony in the Garden when the hand of his Father was upon his ſpirit who did Chriſt take with him into the Garden? Only theſe
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:168534:78"/> three, <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> at verſe, 33. <hi>And he taketh with him</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> James, <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>and began to be ſore amazed, and to be very heavy, and ſaith unto them, my Soul is exceeding ſorrowful unto Death.</hi> Now the thing I would note from hence is this, the Reaſon why Chriſt would take only thoſe three that had ſeen him in his glory to ſee him in his Agony it was, becauſe they were the fitteſt of all thoſe that ſaw Chriſt in his Glory to ſee him in his Agony, they would make the beſt uſe of this more then any. If the other diſciples had ſeen him only in his Agony, and not in his Glory, they might have been offended, to have ſeen their maſter ſo when he came to die to be ſo amazed, they might ſay, Lord, is this he we have truſted ſo long unto, that now when he comes to die he ſweats blood, I but theſe that ſaw him in his Glory, they would rather think, Oh, How willing ſhould we be to ſuffer for Jeſus Chriſt, that he that is ſo glorious as we ſaw him but the other day, now we ſee him in ſuch a caſe; if God ſhould alter our condition, and bring us never ſo low, we have cauſe to humble our ſelves becauſe he was ſo Low: And that he might prepare their hearts alſo to ſuffer, for <hi>James</hi> was the firſt of the Apoſtles that ſuffered for him, <hi>Steven</hi> indeed ſuffered before, but of the Apoſtles <hi>James</hi> was the firſt, and <hi>Peter,</hi> you know what he was to ſuffer, and <hi>John</hi> he was the beloved diſciple, and one of an humble Spirit, and of a loving ſpirit, therefore he was taken in, now the ſight of theſe two together was a ſpecial means to help the humility of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of theſe three Diſciples that they ſaw him in his glory and Agony: And ſo for us to meditate firſt on his Glory, and then of his condition in his Agony, it is a mighty means to humble our ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="622" facs="tcp:168534:79"/>5. But now the laſt thing is: The right knowledg of our ſelves, this is another Means to make us hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, now, the right knowledg of our ſelves is that which ſhould bring our hearts low; it was that that the Heathen did admire, <hi>Sotrates</hi> was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the famous man for this ſentence, <hi>I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe I know my ſelf,</hi> you may conclude it, a man or woman that is lifted up in pride, it is a ſign thou doſt not know thy ſelf, if thou kneweſt all the Myſteries in nature, the nature of the Sun, Moon and Stars, and Arts and Sciences, all is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the knowing of thine own heart: Doſt thou know thine own heart, prize this as a choice thing, it is ſuch a thing thou ſhouldeſt ſpend much time to read<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many of you perhaps cannot read in a book, I but you muſt be learned in the books of your own heart, read that well, and you will know enough there:</p>
               <p>Further, For the knowledg of our ſelves, take pains in frequent examining, and obſerving of thy heart, and examin it by the holineſs and juſtice of God, ſet Gods infinite holineſs and juſtice, even with thine own heart, and that wil make thee know thy heart.</p>
               <p>And if you would know your ſelves, you muſt not judg of your ſelves by what you are in a fit, at a time, but what you are in a conſtant way, thoſe that are the vileſt of all, yet they have ſome good moods and fits, ſometimes ſtirred by the word, and when they are above ſome good motions, and yet be vile and abominable for all this, but you muſt judg what the frame of your Spirits are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God, and eſpecially what you are in time of temptation, how you find your hearts work ordinarily in times of temptation, when you are put to it. There is many a man when there is no
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:168534:79"/> temptation, he ſeems to be as fair, and as humble a man, as lowly a man as can be, but when temptation comes then he flies out. And ſo many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men think they truſt in God, and have Faith in God, but when temptation comes, then they find ſuch diſtruſt and ſuch ſhifting unto unlawfull means to help themſelves; Thus you muſt ſee what you are in an ordinary way; I do not ſay, that a man ſhould judg his condition or his heart for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, but what he is in an ordinary way, as thus: you may know you have a froward Spirit, if you are froward in an ordinary way. When a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes you may know you are unclean and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, though you are not unclean, and drunk every week, but when a temptation comes in an ordinary way, and when a temptation comes &amp; you fal upon that which is evil, and it is not the trouble of your ſpirit, but you ſay, it is the ſtrength of temptation, and we are all ſinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you can paſs it over ſo: Take theſe two Conſiderations with you: Firſt, If that in an ordinary way when temptation comes you find your heart taken. And Secondly, If that you can paſs over a ſin without any trouble in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I ſay then, what you are in your temptation, that you are in the ſight of God, and not what you are in ſome good mood and ſome good fit, but there is the guiſe and the frame of your heart, that that doth appear then, were you otherwiſe in your temptation then you would complain of your heart, and you would ſay, O! here is a temptation, &amp; that makes me ſee that corruption I never ſaw before, and Oh! how doth this trouble you? but if you vent your corruption in a temptation, then you are to judg of your ſelves, according to what you find your ſelves in a temptation, and God will ſo judg you, if there be not an alteration, and if men muſt come to judg of themſelves this way, Oh! what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance

               <p>Theſe are the Heads to meditate upon to know your own vileneſs, and ſo to humble your ſelves before God, theſe are the meditations that may ſerve to prick the bladders of Pride, and beat down the heart when it is lifted up.</p>
               <pb n="625" facs="tcp:168534:80"/>
               <p>As Firſt: Meditate what once you were, conſider that there is never a one of you whatever your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is now, but you were a Child of wrath, and that as wel as others, as well as the vileſt, baſeſt wretch in the world, as you were by nature you you were ſuch as loſt God, had departed from him, were deprived of the Image of God, your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency was departed from you, you were under the curſe of the Law, you were enemies unto God, your life was a continuall enmity unto God, all your daies you did nothing elſe but fight againſt him, you were guilty, condemned Creatures, you were ful of ſin, of the Seeds of all kinds of ſin, there is no ſin in Hell it ſelf but the Seeds of it were in your hearts, your hearts and lives were full of ſin, all the faculties of your Souls were full of ſin, and all the members of your bodies inſtruments of ſin, all the good things you had was defiled, Soul and Body was polluted, and al loathſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you were even caſt out in your blood, and even lived in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, for al the time of your natural condition, al the Creatures that you had uſe of you defiled with ſin, and all Ordinances were polluted, all things were unclean to you: Now theſe are ſome certain Heads to meditate upon, to work upon us the knowledg of our ſelves, what we were in that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtate.</p>
               <p>Beſides add to this, you were ſuccorleſs, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſhiftleſs in your ſelves, you could never deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your ſelves, you were wandring from God, and would have wandred eternally if God had not looked upon you in mercy, you were in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that all the Angels in Heaven, and all the Creatures in the world could not have helped you, there was ſuch a dreadfull breach between God and your Souls, that if all the Angels in Heaven, and men on earth would have been content to have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:168534:81"/> to have made up our breach, it could not have been, this is your condition. Is there not cauſe then you ſhould be low in your own eyes? look back to this condition, you ſee many vile Creatures going on in waies of wickedneſs, provoking the infinite wrath of God againſt them, and hanging over the pit of Hell by a twined Thred, and every moment are ready to be plunged into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Gulf, you were once thus, you were in as vile a condition as they.</p>
               <p>And conſider further, What you might have been, you that are now in ſuch a condition, that have perhaps excellent parts, I have ſpoken now only of our condition in regard of our ſpirituall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, you may conſider of your condition in your riſe and beginning, that what you find your ſelves made of was but Duſt, what poor matter you were made of at firſt and ſo many of you have great eſtates that now you are proud of, but you were low enough, look back to what you were. So the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. when he would humble the People, he bids them look back to what they were, <hi>Your Father an Amorite, and your Mother an Hitite, and you were caſt out into the Streets.</hi> Theſe things if we intended to ſpeak of them largely, they would take up a great deal of time to ſhew them, only now to hint the heads of ſome meditations to you to humble your ſelves.</p>
               <p>But Secondly: Conſider what you might have been if the Lord had taken advantage of you, you are now in a comfortable condition, now you come among the People of God into the aſſembly of the Saints, but you might have been among the damned Reprobates, you might have been roaring in Hell, and ſweltring under the wrath of the infinite God; when others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Gods people were aſſembled to

               <p>Yea, If God had taken you away divers yeers ſince without the knowledg of him, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his Son, In what caſe had you been in, if you had died when ſuch a kinſman of yours died, or ſuch a Neighbor of yours died, where had you been? When you fit in your houſes with your Wife and Children about you, conſider what you might have been, I that ſit here, and have the day of Grace continued to me, might have been in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Gulf, I might have been curſing and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming God, you that God hath wrought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon, you deſire to fear him, and you come to worſhip him, and have ſome delight to worſhip him, if God had left you to your ſelf, you might have gone curſing and ſwearing, and blaſpheming, &amp; committing any vileneſs that any the moſt vileſt have committed. It may God hath enlarged your heart in Prayer, I but if God had left you to your ſelf, inſtead of being enlarged in prayer, you might have been curſing and blaſpheming God: Now this is a mighty means to humble your heart.</p>
               <p>Beſides, What you might have been in regard of poverty, in regard of paine and ſickneſs, you now are comfortable in your Houſes, and ſit with wives and Children, and delight one in another, you might have been in extreamity of torment and pain, you might have loſt your ſenſes, and loſt your limbs, and a Hundred ſuch things might be named, that if you would give your meditations out upon theſe things, you might find enough to keep your hearts low before God.</p>
               <pb n="628" facs="tcp:168534:82"/>
               <p>Thirdly: And the third head is this, If God hath made any change in your State, What a trouble it put Heaven and Earth unto, that the Son of God muſt take your nature upon him, and die, and be made a Curſe, to deliver you from that condition? Now this is a mighty humbling conſideration, for if a Man or Woman had done any ſuch thing as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves puniſhment, though they be delivered, yet if they know that the deliverance coſt abundance of trouble, for a Child to think, my Father might have caſt me off, and I might have been a loſt Child, I but what a deal of charge and trouble have I put my Father to? I have been a trouble to the Family, and to my Friends: So here, God hath not caſt us down to Hel as he might have done; But O! what a deal of trouble have we put God unto, &amp; Heaven unto, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, muſt come and be made a Curſe for me? the thoughts of this ſhould humble us, it is true, to conſider of the torments of Hel is very humbling, but to conſider of the way of Gods delivering us from thoſe torments, is as great a means to humble us as any thing in the world.</p>
               <p>Yea, Fourthly: Conſider what thou art now, though God hath delivered thee: Thou haſt yet a body of ſin and death that thou carrieſt about with thee, Oh, abundance of ſin and corruption remains in thy Soul, Conſider that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 24. <hi>O! wretched man that I am who ſhal deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Conſider thine unworthy walking for all thoſe good things thou haſt received from God, that notwithſtanding all that ever God hath done for thee, yet thou walkeſt ſo unworthily as thou doſt and God foreſaw this, that thou wouldeſt walk thus unworthily and wretchedly before him, the thoughts of this, that there is ſuch unkindneſs
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:168534:82"/> offere do God, that thou that hopeſt to receive ſuch greatt things from God, and perſwadeſt thy ſelf that God hath done ſuch great things for thee, as he hath in ſending his Son to die for thee, I ſay, the thoughts of this, is as humbling a conſideration as any can be conceived of, next unto that one, what Chriſt did for us, and what our ſouls coſt, our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a mercy, and our unanſwerableneſs to ſuch a mercy is a mighty humbling conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and indeed, it would be a good Argument to perſwade, that thou art one that God hath done ſuch things for in Chriſt, if ſo be thou canſt find, that the thoughts of what he hath done for thee, makes thee humble ſo much the more, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of al thine unworthy walking for what he hath done for thee, here is matter enough for meditation to humble the Soul in the preſence of God, if theſe things be conſidered, what yet thou art.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: Another head is this, what thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be if God ſhould but leave thee; though he hath done great things for thee, and ſhewed thee himſelf, and Chriſt, and ſhewed thee the evil of ſin, and eternal life, yet for al this if he ſhould but leave thee to thy ſelf one quarter of an hour, thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt depart from him, and loſe al that Grace thou haſt, and be brought into a miſerable condition as ever thou wert, thou wouldſt be plunged into the depth of al evil. Yea, if God ſhould but withdraw his Spirit from thee one moment Oh conſider what thou wouldeſt be! and if God ſhould come out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee in his anger and diſpleaſure, what a dreadful change would there be of that condition in which now thou art. Now indeed thou haſt a great many things wherein thy heart is ſatisfied and delighted and many excellencies thou haſt that
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:168534:83"/> perhaps thy heart is lifted up in, but what woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou be in regard of thy ſpirituals if God ſhould withdraw from thee, thou wouldeſt leave all thy ſpiritual eſtate, thou wouldeſt be in a worſe condition than ever thou wert. And for thy natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eſtate, thy parts of nature, or activity of body, or ſtrength, what would become of them if God ſhould withdraw from thee. And ſo thy outward eſtate, how ſoon might God ſend fire upon thy Houſe, or upon thy Ship, and how ſoon mighteſt thou loſe all, and be brought into woful extremity; you that enjoy much now, yet meditate what you might be in a moment, if God ſhould withdraw himſelf from you, and eſpecially if he ſhould come out againſt you.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and Laſtly: Conſider what you will be ere long, certainly your outward eſtate will be gone, whatever you pride your ſelves in, Beauty, or Health, or Strength, or Parts, it wil be gone and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, your ſtrength wil be turned into weakneſs, and your Health into ſickneſs, this body of yours that now you deck and trim muſt be Wormes meat ere long, and lie rotting in the Duſt; And what difference wil there be between thoſe that are rich and thoſe that are poor. I remember I have read of one, that coming into a place where was a heap of Skuls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and among others he heard that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> Skul lay there, he deſires to know of the man which was <hi>Alexanders</hi> Skul, ſaith the man, yonder Skul that hath hollow eyes, ſaith he to the man, al Skuls hath this, I ſaith the man, and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> too, there is no difference between <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> Skul, and others Skuls, Death makes al the ſame. You that are rich and above others, and your Hearts are ready to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uft up within a while what difference will there be between an
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:168534:83"/> Almes-body and you? may be this difference will then be, that the poor man if he dies, he hath not ſo much to anſwer for ſo many Talents, and you die and have had great talents, and you have all them to anſwer for; Do but conſider of this, what you wil be if theſe things be taken from you, and that will prick the Bladder of Pride in reſpect of your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall condition.</p>
               <p>And what State you will be in, Conſider this, you muſt ſtand naked before the great judgment Seat of God, every one of you that are here, you muſt after a while ſtand naked before the dreadful judgment Seat of God, to receive your dreadful doom for whatſoever you have done in the Fleſh. Now you had need to walk humbly before the Lord here, conſidering what you ſhal be brought under, to ſtand naked before him, and give an account of al your waies; whatever you are proud of you muſt give account of it before God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all your Grace, how you have uſed it. Now you that want matter of meditation, and want matter of Prayer, when you go to Prayer, you would fain go and humble your heart, and you would go and meditate, and you cannot meditate, you find your thoughts very barren, theſe things that have been here ſpoken, may be ſome kind of ſupply to you for meditation, and to help you in Prayer to humble your ſelves there, and bring your ſpirits Low, caſt but your thoughts upon theſe ſeveral heads, What was I? What was I in my natural eſtate? What I might have been if God had taken advantage of me, how he might have taken me in the Act of ſin, at ſuch a time, in ſuch a place, and if he had taken me, what had become of me then? And then, what a great deal of trouble it was to Heaven and Earth to redeem my ſoul; and what am I yet, in al the faculties of my ſoul, and
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:168534:84"/> members of my Body, what a wretched heart I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about with me ſtil; and what ſhould I be if God ſhould withdraw himſelf from me? the Lord hath been gracious to me, but if he ſhould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> withdraw himſelf from me, what ſhould become of me? And what ſhal I be both in my naturals, and likewiſe when I ſhal ſtand before the great God to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all my waies? now the working of theſe things again and again upon my heart, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the making uſe of theſe things in Prayer, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theſe things before the Lord in Prayer, or mention theſe things when you are between God and your own ſouls, and beſeeching the Lord that he would ſettle theſe things upon your ſouls, to humble your hearts, it would be a mighty means to bring your hearts low, and to keep them low. This ſhal ſuffice for adding to what was ſaid, for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of us to this humble frame of heart.</p>

And when we name it, I ſuppoſe it will ſeem one of the ſtrangeſt points that ever was preached or that you have heard of: That the way of the Goſpel to bring People to Heaven, is an eaſie way, it ſeems contrary to other Scriptures, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtraight Gate, for ſtraight is the Gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it,</hi> and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters tel us, the way to Heaven is a very difficult way, and many times it is made an evidence of men that are but carnal, and have not the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in them, that they find ſo much eaſe in their way; I ſuppoſe theſe you have heard of. Well, before we have done with the Point, we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all theſe things, only for the preſent ſeeing
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:168534:87"/> they are the words of Chriſt, we muſt yeild them to have a truth in them: That the Yoke of Chriſt whatever it is that Chriſt would have us ſubmit unto, it is eaſie, whatever Burden he would have us bear in this world, it is a light Burden: Let all thoſe that are continually complaining of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that lie in the waies of Godlineſs take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this Point, many there are, that make it their Religion to be continually complaining of difficulties that there are in Gods waies, as if by that they would ſhew that they ſaw ſomewhat, and felt ſomewhat more than others did, and are never in waies of thankſgiving, or in waies of rejoycing, but alwaies complaining of the waies of God, and what difficulties they find in them, let them take notice, that whatever thy thoughts have been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, or what thy Speeches have been about them, yet Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſaith, that <hi>his Yoke is eaſie,</hi> and of his <hi>Burden that it is light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore, Firſt I ſhall confirm it by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and then come to branch it into ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars for the opening of it.</p>
               <p>For Scriptures, take theſe three, the firſt is in <hi>Pſal. 119. 44, 45. So ſhall I keep thy Law continually for ever and ever, and I will walk at liberty, for I ſeek thy Precepts.</hi> The Soul that doth truly ſeek Gods precepts, to be under the command of the precepts of God, ſuch a one walks at liberty, never hath ſo much liberty as at that time when he ſeeks Gods precepts You may think that to be under the command of the word, and eſpecially that in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the commands of the Lord, it will bring you into bondage: There is no ſuch liberty in the world as being under the command of God, and ſeeking the commands of the word. And then in

                  <hi>Prov. 15. 19. The way of the ſlothfull is as a hedg of Thorns,</hi> that is, there is a great deal of difficulty in the way of the ſlothful, now this is an oppoſition to the waies of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now if you be walking in any place from Town to Town, if you walk in a place where is plain way in the fields, it is eaſie all the while. Now you go to the City, and you walk in the fields, it is plain, it is eaſie, but when you come upon ſtones, it is more difficult, So it is here, <hi>The way of the righteous is plain,</hi> the righteous have a plain path to Heaven, but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked they are upon the ſtones, they are upon the dirt, when one comes upon the ſtones, and it be dirty too, that is more difficult, <hi>But the way of righteouſneſs is plain.</hi> And there is one Scripture more remarkable than theſe, and that is, in 1 <hi>John 5. 3.

                  </gap>thing that God requires of thee if thou underſtandeſt it aright that will grieve thee; when you tender a Child or a Friend, you wil not require of them any thing that may grieve them, now Chriſt hath ſo tender regard unto you that are the Servants of God, that he will require nothing of you that wil grieve you, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if nothing be grievous in Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſurely his Yoke is e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now for the opening of this Point (for there
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:168534:88"/> is a great deal that had need to be ſaid to it for the opening of it, and making it uſefull and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) I ſhall caſt what my meditations have been about this Point into theſe Six heads.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, To give you ſome Evidences of it, that this is ſo.</p>
               <p>And then the ſecond thing is, The differences that there are between the eaſe that a carnall heart finds in the waies of Religion, and the eaſe that a true Gracious heart finds in the waies of Religion; thoſe that are carnall, and take up but a meer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of Religion, they find not eaſe, but thoſe that are truly religious, they find reſt.</p>
               <p>And the third is this, If the waies of God be eaſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How comes it to paſs, that many that we hope are truly Gracious and Godly, yet make ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of ſo much difficulty as they do find in Gods waies.</p>
               <p>And then fourthly, We are to open (which is the principal of all in the explication) wherein the eaſineſs of Gods waies appears, what are thoſe things that do make the waies of God ſo eaſie, and in what particulars doth conſiſt the eaſineſs that there is in the waies of Religion.</p>
               <p>And then fifthly, Some Conſequences that are to be drawn from this, which is by way of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And ſixthly and laſtly, Some Directions, what we ſhould do to make the waies of God eaſie, Theſe are the ſix Heads that I caſt the handling of this Point into.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Six Evidences of the former Doctrine in the laſt Chapter. 1. Becauſe the word that injoyns theſe waies is Sweet. 2. A Gracious Soul counts his Duties his priviledges. 3. He would rather come under any other Burden, than caſt off the Yoke of Chriſt. 4. Becauſe Chriſt whoſe Yoke it is, is Gentle. 5. Never any truly that put their neck un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Yoke, would willingly take it out again 6. The Experience of all the Saints of God prove the Point.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOr the firſt then: The Evidences that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that certainly the waies of God are eaſie, and his Burden is very light unto thoſe that have indeed ſubmitted their necks unto the Yoke of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <div n="1" type="evidence">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 1.</head>
                  <p>Firſt. The firſt Evidence is this: Surely Gods waies are eaſie unto them, for there is none that is truly Gracious, but they account the word of God that doth require them to walk in thoſe waies, very ſweet unto them, and they prize it highly, now if there were difficulty and a harſhneſs in Gods waies. Certainly, though the word of God may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted juſt and righteous, yet it would not be ſweet and comfortable unto the Soul; but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:168534:89"/> more ſweet and comfortable unto a Gracious heart, than the word of God that doth require ſuch waies of him. Ye know the expreſſion of <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>It is ſweeter than the Hony and the Hony Comb, more precious than Silver or Gold,</hi> or any riches of the world, read but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. and there in every verſe almoſt, you find ſuch expreſſions, of much ſweetneſs that <hi>David</hi> did find in the word of God, if the word be ſweet and delightful, certainly the waies of God muſt needs be ſweet and delightfull that are required in the word, that is the firſt.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="evidence">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 2.</head>
                  <p>Secondly: Surely they are ſweet and delightful, for thoſe that are in Gods waies, do not account what they do only to be Duties, but Priviledges; they look upon every thing that Chriſtian Religion requires of them, not only as Duties, but as Mercies, as that wherein their happineſs conſiſts, <hi>I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived mercy from the Lord that I may be faithful</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> I do not ſay, I have received mercy from the Lord, that I may go to Heaven, that I may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and have ſuch and ſuch bleſſings, but I count it mercy from the Lord, that he makes me faithfull in this way, not only dutifull, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The Saints of God do not account the bonds of obedience to be fetters to them, they account them chains of Gold about their necks for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not bonds of neceſſity to tie them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, becauſe otherwiſe they would not obey them, but I ſay, every Law of God is counted by the Saints of God to be as chains of Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to them, that they account their Glory as wel as their Duty, &amp; therefore in the <hi>Revelation</hi> we find, the new City is deſcribed thus, that her ſtreets is paved with Gold, that is, the very way &amp; path of the Saints it is a Golden way, it is paved with Gold,
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:168534:89"/> it is a glorious way, now that which a man accounts his Priviledg, and Dignity, &amp; Glory, that muſt needs be eaſie, their ſuffering actively and paſſively, <hi>Paul</hi> counts his ſufferings Glorious, and <hi>Moſes</hi> counts his ſufferings more than the riches of <hi>Egypt.</hi> If ſo be that you had given unto you as much Gold as you could carry, the weightier the bag, the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would your heart be, you would count the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſo much the more lighter, by ſo much the more was in it, Certainly, the ſuffering for Chriſt, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſt is riches, it is ſo to a Gracious heart, may be this may be a Riddle to carnal hearts, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny carnall hearts think they muſt do ſuch good things, and if they do not, they muſt periſh, and go to Hell, and therefore they force themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Duty, I but it is otherwiſe with a Godly heart, he doth not think, I muſt do this, but his work is wages, every work that a Child of God doth is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to him, the man works hard, I but he expects the more, he expects wages: So an Hypocrite may work, he may do ſomthing, but he expects wages, but a Gracious heart his work is wages, <hi>Receiving the end of your Faith, the Salvation of your Souls,</hi> there is receiving continually while we are working. Saith Chriſt in <hi>Joh. 17. 4. Father I have finiſhed the work that thou gaveſt me to do:</hi> So the very work that the Father ſet Chriſt upon, Chriſt did count it to be a Gift from the Father, and ſo the work that Chriſt ſets us upon, if we have the Spirit of Chriſt in us, we wil count it a Gift from Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt doth give it, and this (by the way) would be a ſpecial Evidence of true Grace in the heart, the ſoul that ſhall count Gods waies Priviledges as well as Duties, ſurely hath true Grace, truly they are eaſie then, if they be Priviledges as wel as Duties, that is the ſecond.</p>

                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 3</head>
                  <p>Thirdly: And the third Evidence is this, The Yoke of Chriſt is eaſie, and his Burden is light; for there is no gracious heart but would rather come under any Yoke, any Burden in the world, than willingly to caſt off any Yoke and Burden of Jeſus Chriſt, name what Yoke you will, what Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den you will, rather than a gracious heart will be from under Chriſts Burden, and Chriſts Yoke, O! ſaith he, let me come under that Yoke, and that Burden.</p>
                  <p>Yea further, If God doth put any Yoke, any Burden of affliction upon one that is Gracious, if that Yoke and Burden of affliction may but bring his neck more under the Yoke of Chriſt than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and bring him more under Chriſts Burden than before, a gracious heart doth think it well worth the bearing, thinks himſelf fully recompenſed in the bearing of any Yoke if it may any way further him to come under the Yoke of Chriſt more; as thus, before I had a wanton Spirit, and I could not get my ſelf to put my neck under the Yoke of Chriſt, to be quiet as I ought to have been; Well, but now the Lord Chriſt hath laid the Yoke of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction upon me, and that hath in ſome meaſure ſubdued my heart, ſo that I can come and put the Yoke of Chriſt upon me better, O! bleſſed be God that ever I had the Yoke of affliction upon me, that now brings me under the yoke of Chriſt more, Canſt thou ſay ſo, bleſſed be God for this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Surely then the Yoke of Chriſt is eaſie, that a heart is willing to bear any Yoke that may but further it to the bearing of the Yoke of Chriſt, that is the third.</p>

                     <hi>Evidence</hi> 4.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly: It is an eaſie Yoke certainly, for it is Chriſts Yoke, it muſt needs be eaſie, becauſe it is Chriſts, and that upon theſe two grounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt: Chriſt himſelf is Gentle, and Sweet, and Lovely, Chriſt himſelf hath no Rigidneſs, no Sowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in him towards People, as you heard at large when we opened the Meekneſs and Lowlineſs of Chriſt, now if Chriſt be meek and lowly, he loves no bitterneſs and rigidneſs. If I had to deal with a man that I were ſure had all the Meekneſs, and al the Love and all the Gentleneſs in him of all the men in the world that ever lived, put all their Meekneſs, and Gentleneſs, and Sweetneſs together into one man, and I were ſure I ſhould never have any Yoke upon me but what that man ſhould lay upon me, truly, I would never fear any rigidneſs. One man hath Meekneſs and Gentleneſs, I but he hath Rigidneſs too, and another man hath one drop, and another another drop, I but put all theſe into one, and ſurely that man hath a great deal of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, now Jeſus Chriſt hath all in him, and if it be his Yoke, then it muſt needs be eaſie.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly: Conſider what was the end of Chriſts coming into the world, the end of Jeſus Chriſts coming into the world was this, he ſaw poor wretched man, that he was under a Burden of ſin and miſery, and he was content to come and take their natures upon him, and deliver their ſouls from pain, and trouble, and miſery, he came not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to impoſe Iron Yokes, but he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to bring the mercy of the Father, to bring the treaſure of the riches of the Father into the world, and was anointed by the Father to that end, that he might open Priſon doors to Captives,
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:168534:91"/> and that he might powr oyle upon <hi>them, to ſupple ſouls that was his end, ſaith he, I came not into the world to condemne it, but to ſave it</hi> that I might bring the mercy of my father into the world, that I might open the paſſages of the infinite mercy of my Father that by your ſins was ſhut up, though there was an infinite ocean of mercy in my Father, yet not one drop could iſſue out from him, therefore I came to open the ſluces, as it were, and let them out upon you, and if there be any other end, it is rather by accident then that which Chriſt aymed at, but that Chriſt aymed at was, to open the ſluces of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy of God upon man. Now if this were the end of Chriſts comming into the world, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thoſe that are deare to him, and that he was willing to lay down his life for, they ſhal find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him but gentleneſs, he will lay no yoke or burden upon them but what is very eaſy, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light therefore it muſt needs be eaſy, becauſe it is Chriſts, that is a fourth Evidence</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="evidence">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Evidence,</hi> 5.</head>
                  <p>Fiftly, It muſt needs be eaſy and light, for there was never any in the world that put his neck under this Yoke, (eſpecially if you take it for the yoke of obedience) never any put his neck under this yoke that would have his neck out again, that would wiſh Chriſts yoke otherwiſe then it is, for his active obedience and they would have the paſſive too, but in the concluſion they would never repent them that ever they were under it, but eſpecially for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, there was never Godly Chriſtians when they were themſelves, and did conſider of things, except it were in time of temptation, but take them at that time when they are themſelves, I ſay, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any that could wiſh their neck out of Chriſts
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:168534:91"/> yoke, that could wiſh the yoke of Chriſt eaſier then it is, they would be freed from nothing that Chriſt requires when they are themſelves and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand things. It is true, Ignorantly, and when they do not underſtand things, and in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, then they may do otherwiſe, but take a Chriſtian, and let him be himſelf, and let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and underſtand the thing, and there was never any that could wiſh his neck out of the yoke, or wiſh it eaſier then it is. It is true, a gracious heart may be weary of himſelf, becauſe he cannot beare the yoke of Chriſt as he would do, but he is never weary of Chriſts yoke, he may be weary of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his heart that hinder him from bearing the yoke as he ſhould do, but he would not have the yoke leſs then it is, Take one that is Godly, though he be weak, you will ſay, it is true, they that are ſtrong wil not wiſh it leſs, but thoſe that are weak they may well conſider it thus, a gracious heart he would be glad to have more ſtrength to go under Chriſts yoke more comfortably, but he would not have Chriſts yoke leſs, that is, there is no duty that Chriſt requires of a gracious heart that it would be freed from, I appeal to you that are gracious hearts what one duty that Chriſt requires of you when you are your ſelves, that you would be freed from, Look through the whol book of God, and you ſhal find it ſo of the Saints. And here is a great difference now between an Hypocrite, and a Gracious man, an Hipocrite would fain do this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but not that, and omit this, but not that; but a gracious heart ſaith, Lord, I am not willing only to do what thou requireſt of me, but Lord, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou requireſt of me, I would chuſe it, if I had my choice, but I leave that till I come further, only now to ſhew that it is eaſy, becauſe no gracious heart that will ever take up any other yoke, but
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:168534:92"/> ſaith, let me alwaies be here, ſurely it muſt needs be eaſy then; that is a fifth Evidence.</p>

                  <head>Evidence, 6</head>
                  <p>And the Sixth and Laſt Evidence is this, it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the experience of the Saints, and that is as great a demonſtration as any thing, that which I have found experimentally, that I find ſo, it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the experience of the Saints, there is none that are truly Gracious though they may be afflicted with temptation, eſpecially when they are grown in the waies of Chriſtianity, but they have ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it, perhaps at firſt they find it ſomwhat hard to get their necks under, but afterwards, they will ſay, well, I never found that reſt, that eaſe, that quiet upon my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oul, as ſince I got my neck ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the yoke of Chriſt, ſince I brought my ſelf to reſign my ſelf fully &amp; wholly to the ways of Jeſus Chriſt, I bleſs God I have had great eaſe and reſt. Juſt as it is with your ſhips, if your ſhip Stick faſt in the Sands and water, the Waves come and beat againſt your ſhip, and it is ready to break, but now if it is got off from the Sands, and wholly upon the Water, then away it goes, and you may hold a cup of wine in your hands and it goes away with eaſe, ſo it is with a Godly heart, when he is part in Gods waies, and part in the mudd, and doth not fully give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Gods waies, then he findes trouble, and his Conſcience flies in his Face, and he cannot ſleep quietly, but let the Soul fully reſign it ſelf to Chriſt to be guided by him, Oh! the unſpeakable joy that there is in this. Heathens may talk, and have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diſcourſes about tranquillity of mind, but only the true Criſtian can have the <hi>true tranquillity of mind, never could the</hi> ſoul ſay till now, my ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:168534:92"/> unto thy reſt, let there be never ſuch commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world, and troubles and ſtirs in the World, yet I can retire to God, and I can bleſs my ſelf in God, and bleſs God in what I injoy, when I can ſay as in the preſence of God to my ſoul, O my Soul, return to thy reſt, I never had ſuch reſt and quiet in any waies as I find in theſe. Surely theſe Six things do evidence the truth, that his yoke is eaſy, and his burden light.</p>

                     <hi>The Second Particular mentioned,</hi> Chap. 13. <hi>Is opened in two differences between a Carnal heart, and a Gracious Soul, in the waies of God. 1 The Hypocrite finds eaſe in the waies of God and Sin both. 2. The Hypocrite hath ſome eaſe, becauſe he miſtaks the Yoke of Chriſt, contenting himſelf with the outward forme of Godlineſs, but theb eleevers eaſe comes from the power of it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt now many carnal hearts, they think it eaſie: Gracious hearts may think this point at firſt hearing very ſtrange, but carnal hearts they think, I, we like this point wel enough, for men keep ſuch a do, and make the waies of God ſo difficult, to go on in a faire way, that is eaſy, but to be put to ſo much trouble and pains, there muſt be Such praying, and humbling, and ſuch ſtrict keeping of the Sabbaths, this is that diſturbs, now becauſe civil men, they find eaſe as well as carnal hearts, that will be the next thing, for Indeed, I was loth to ſpeak ſo much of the eaſineſs of the waies of Chriſt without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difference between the reſt, and eaſe of a carnal heart or an Hipocrite, and a true Gracious
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:168534:93"/> heart, an Hipocrite and a carnal heart ſhal find no eaſe and reſt at al though a gracious heart ſhal</p>
               <p>Wherfore the differences between that eaſe which a carnal heart finds, and that which a gracious heart finds in Gods ways they are many.</p>
               <p>Firſt of al, a carnal heart finds eaſe in Chriſts yoke and eaſe in the yoke of ſin both, they find eaſe in both yokes, when they have a temptation to ſin, that is comfortable to them, when it is ſuitable to their own ends to their own waies, when they come to performe duty and come to the Church, and ſomtimes pray, and receive Sacraments, and the like, they think they find a great deal of eaſe there, they are content with both, now it is quite otherwiſe with a gracious heart, a gracious heart finds eaſe in the yoke of Chriſt, but there is nothing more burdenſom to a gracious heart then the yoke of ſin, the yoke of Chriſt is ſuch an eaſe as cannot ſtand: with eaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of any ſin, but the yoke of ſin it is burdenſome and intollerable unto the heart that hath true eaſe in the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt. Yea, and the more eaſe any gracious heart hath in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the yoke of Chriſt, the more intolerable is the burden that ſuch a heart hath when it is under the yoke of ſin; if at any time ſin doth prevail with one that is come under ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt, O! how greivous is that ſin, and therefore greivous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a foul knows what the difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the yoke of Chriſt, and the yoke of ſin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is grievous, It is not only greivous, becauſe it brings terror to the ſoul through fear of judgment and fear of hell, but it is grievous, becauſe the ſoul knows a difference between the yoke of Chriſt and the yoke of ſin. As now, if a man hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a ſervice to ſome Noble man or
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:168534:93"/> Prince, and hath a great deale of Honor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and gained very much, and afterwards this man ſhould come to be a ſlave in the Gallies, Oh, how burdenſom would this be to him upon this ground, becauſe he once knew a better ſervice, he knew what it was to ſerve ſuch a Prince, that was a gracious Prince, and loved him and delighted in him, and required nothing of him but that that was very ſuitable to him, now if ſuch a one comes to the Gally, it will be very greivous. Truly thus it is, a true Gracious heart, that hath been acquainted with the yoke of Chriſt, if at any time he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with any corruption, with any ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is like one in the Gally, Oh, this ſoul conſiders, I am in a different way from what I was wont to be, I was wont to be in the ſervice of Jeſus Chriſt, and my heart had ſoul ſatisfying contentments while I was there, but O what a difference is there in this work? here is a baſe drudgery in compariſon of what I was wont to have, Oh, the ſweet communion I had with Jeſus Chriſt while my heart kept cloſe to him, but now, now I am raking in kennells, and rowing in Gallies, Oh! <hi>wretched man that I am, who ſhal deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from this burden?</hi> now this is a wide, a broad difference, between the eaſineſs of the yoke of Chriſt to one and to the other, one finds a great deal of eaſe in the yoke, but the other finds all one, if he goes amongſt company that are vaine, and ſleight, and prophane, and when he comes to hear the word to read or receive the Sacrament, almoſt all one; and indeed, if there be any difference, his greateſt eaſe is in that of ſin; he hath eaſe in the duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in performing duties, but his greateſt eaſe is in the other way; I but now, the eaſe of a Saint is ſuch as cannot ſtand with the eaſe of ſin, a child of God can beare the yoke of Chriſt with eaſe, but he cannot beare the yoke of ſin, it is death to
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:168534:94"/> him to beare the yoke of ſin, that is the Firſt</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another difference is this, a carnall heart may have ſome eaſe in duties of religion, in the yoke of Chriſt, but it is becauſe he miſtakes the yoke of Chriſt, it is becauſe he doth not know the yoke of Chriſt, he thinks that the yoke of Chriſt is only ſome external duties that Chriſt requires, or to keep from ſome groſſe ſins, and now and then to ſay his prayers, and now and then to read a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and come to Church, and to receive Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, he thinks this is all that Chriſt requires of him, what needs any more to do then this? May not I go to Heaven as well with this, as with keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much a do as others do? and he thinks here is the yoke of Chriſt, and this is fine and eaſy indeed. If this were the way that would bring to Heaven, it were a very eaſy matter to go to Heaven, that is, for a man to keep from a groſs foul ſin, that would make him odious in the place where he lives, and for him only to come from his houſe, and ſit an hour or two and heare a Sermon, and come at Eaſter and other times and receive the Sacrament, this is the eaſieſt thing in the world, who would not go to Heaven if this were all: But now, if thou wert ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſpiritualneſs of holy duties that Jeſus Chriſt requires, with the power of Godlineſs that there is in holy duties that Chriſt requires in the word, mortification of thy Luſt, and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy thoughts, and of thy heart holy and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he requires that thou ſhouldeſt ſerve the Lord thy God withal thy heart and all thy might, if thou kneweſt (I ſay) the ſpiritualneſs of holy duties, and the power of Godlineſs that is in holy duties, then it would be an intolerable burden to thee, it
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:168534:94"/> would be very grievous to a carnall heart to put it ſelf under the ſpirituall acts of Religion; to put it ſelf under the outward acts of Religion that is eaſie, but to put it ſelf upon the inward acts of Religion, they would find that to be ſomwhat indeed. For one that hath learned a Prayer, to go and ſay it over, and read it in a Book: What an eaſie matter is that part of Religion? for a man in the morning and evening, to go and turn over two or three Leaves, and ſhake himſelf and go away, and then there is Religion for all that day. But now if you would ſet your ſelves to the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Prayer, that is, when you come to Prayer, to meditate what an Infinite, and Glorious, and eternall God you have to deal withall in Prayer, I am now coming to tender up that high reſpect that I owe to the infinite God, that which the Creature ows to an infinite Creator, now I am coming to open my Soul to God, to ſearch out all the corruptions of my heart, and I am now coming to bewail them in the preſence of the infinite God, and to ſet my ſelf before the Lord, as in my ſelf a condemned Creature before an infinite Judg, I am coming now to plead with God for my life, for my Soul, for my eternall eſtate, I am now coming to engage my Soul to God, that as ever I expect mercy in the day of Chriſt, ſo I am willing to give up my ſelf to God, here is ſome power of Godlineſs in this, now I would have you put your ſelves to this divine eaſe, the more a Gracious heart doth this, the more eaſe he hath in Prayer, as I will appeal to you; Take a carnall heart, ſuch a one thinks he muſt pray, and ſo he comes in the morning, and ſpeaks a few words, ſuch words as he was wont to do, and ſuch words as may be he hath heard o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men ſpeak when he joyns with others in prayer, and he hears ſome expreſſions in prayer
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:168534:95"/> from them, and he gets them, and comes in the morning and ſpeaks them, and perhaps gets into his Cloſet, and barely ſpeaks them over, now if it be one that hath true Grace, alas, he is in a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome condition all the day after, if he find not the power of Godlineſs in it, ſuch a one hath no quiet in his Spirit al the day after, Why? becauſe there hath not been the power of Godlineſs in his Duty, and therefore he is troubled all the day long. But now, let ſuch a one come to Prayer to purpoſe in the morning, and ſtir up the life and power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in Prayer, worſhipping God as a God, Oh! the eaſe and quiet that ſuch a one hath all the day, he can go on in his work, and can ſing at his work: So that the eaſe of a Gracious heart, comes from the power of Godlineſs in a Duty, and from the ſpiritualneſs that is in a Duty: but the eaſe of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall heart comes from the formality of a Duty, as becauſe the Duty is formall, and he thinks that it is the Yoke of Chriſt and this is pretty wel, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie indeed, to have no other Yoke than this, to worſhip God in a few words, and not to have the power of Godlineſs in the Duty. And ſo we might inſtance in the hearing of the word, you come to the word barely, you riſe out of your bed, and come and ſit here an hour, that is eaſie enough, but now if you come to the word with preparation, and think now I am going into the preſence of God, to hear what God hath to ſay to my Soul this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Oh, my Soul, what is it that is in thee amiſs? What is it that thou wouldeſt fain have the word come cloſe unto, to help thee againſt? What is the ſpeciall corruption thou wouldeſt have the word to mortifie in thee? If now you ſet your ſelves before you come to the word, to examin your hearts, and when you are there, to attend to the word as that which is your life, upon which your eternall
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:168534:95"/> eſtate depends, and ſo to ſanctifie the name of God in his word, and not to dare to caſt off any truth, knowing that your Soul may lie upon that very truth, and to drink in the word of God in every thing that is revealed according to Gods mind, this will be a very hard thing, you will complain of almoſt an intolerable Burden. But now a gracious heart finds more eaſe, when it Sanctifies God in the power of Godlineſs in hearing the word, than in a formall Duty. Alas! when ſuch a one comes in a formall way, and goes away and gets nothing, ſuch a one is troubled at ſuch a Sermon, it brings more Burden and grief to ſuch a heart, to come to the word and not find profit by the word, than any other thing can do, almoſt nothing can be more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult than this. You find no difference, you come to the word and you get nothing, and you go away with as much comfort as at other times, it is as eaſie to you; but now a Gracious heart cannot find eaſe except he finds Chriſt in the Duty, but you can find eaſe in holy Duties though you never find Jeſus Chriſt in holy Duties; I appeal to you, if this thing God would be pleaſed to ſettle upon the hearts of Men and Women, it might be a very great ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their hearts, you perform holy Duties, What is the eaſe in holy Duties? meerly the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Duty, but now if your eaſe were that which is the eaſe of a true Gracious heart, it comes from the meeting with Jeſus Chriſt in holy Duties.</p>
               <p>And ſo for the Sabboth, how eaſie is it to keep the Sabboth, to do as the moſt, it is eaſie, Why? Becauſe you do not now work in your calling as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daies you do, and you put on your beſt Cloaths, and come and meet with your Neighbors, and ſo you come to Church and home again, and have better fare at your Tables than other daies, and
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:168534:96"/> ſomtimes walk up and down the Fields, this is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: But now the Saints find the eaſe of the Sabboth to be this, that whereas upon the week day I am buſied about other things, and ſo have not that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Communion with Jeſus Chriſt as at other times, now upon the Sabboth my Soul comes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy more immediate communion with Jeſus Chriſt, when I awake I am put upon it more to mind ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, to prepare my heart for him, And now this whol day is dedicated for my converſe with Jeſus Chriſt, and it is no more to me but the very Type and forerunner of that eternall Sabboth that I hope to enjoy in the higheſt Heavens hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſo it is eaſie to me. Now methinks, whatever trouble I have in the week time in my buſineſs in my calling, the Sabboth day that refreſheth me again and makes me fit for my calling, and my heart that was ſo perplexed with outward croſſes, and with the troubles of the world, that did ſo dead and dul my Spirit, the Sabboth quickens me again and adds new ſtrength again, for I have found Chriſt refreſhing my Soul? Now is there not a wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the eaſe of a carnall heart and a Gracious heart in holy Duties? The one meerly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes the Yoke of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo for the Sacrament, It is an eaſie thing for a man to come in his beſt Cloaths, and take a piece of Bread and a cup of Wine, but he knows not what is the power of Godlineſs in ſuch a holy Duty, he thinks that the outward coming to the Sacrament makes amends for all, though he hath been a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed carnall wretch the week before, now if he comes to the Sacrament, the meer performing the Duty, that makes amends, though there be no preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before, no ſpiritualneſs in the Sacrament, no diſcerning of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Jeſus Chriſt, no cloſing of his heart with
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:168534:96"/> Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament, no engaging his Soul to God, no renewing his Covenant with God as he comes to receive the Seal of Gods Covenant with him, no ſuch things. But now a Gracious heart cannot find eaſe in taking the Sacrament, except it find Chriſt, the eaſe it hath in the Sacrament, it is in preparing the Soul for communion with Jeſus Chriſt, it is in the exerciſe of Faith and repentance, the more Faith is exerciſed and the more Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance exerciſed, the more the heart is broken in the Sacrament, the more eaſe a man hath, and the more he gets his heart engaged to God in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the more he hath renewed his Covenant, the more eaſe he hath, I, when a man can go to the Sacrament and do this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O! this is a good day indeed. And indeed this I am ſpeaking upon, is as great a point of Religion for the helping of you to know the frame &amp; diſpoſition of your hearts, &amp; how things ſtand between God and your Souls, as any thing I know; What it is in holy Duties that brings moſt eaſe to your Souls, whether it be the bare externall performance of them, or the ſpirituall performance of them, is the power of Godlineſs in them? that holy Duties for the matter of them cannot ſatisfie your heart, except you find your hearts ſanctified by them, and Gods name ſanctified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>Containeth a third and fourth Difierence between the eaſe of a Hypocrite, and true Beleever in the waies of God. For, 1. They are eaſie even to the Corruptions of a Hypocrite. 2. He takes up the waies God partially.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THirdly: Another Difference is this: The eaſe a carnall heart finds, it may not only ſtand with the eaſe under the Yoke of ſin to the Fleſh, but the truth is, even the Duties of Religion are eaſie to their corruptions, to their very corruptions, not only may ſtand with their corrupt waies, but are eaſie to the very corruption it ſelf, to the very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſtemper of their hearts, this is a very evill and vile eaſe, for to perform holy Duties ſo, as to be eaſie to the very fleſh, to the fleſhly part, Indeed, the Yoke of Chriſt is eaſie unto the Saints, but it is not eaſie unto the fleſh, I mean to the corrupt part, it is not eaſie to that, I but the waies of Religion to carnall hearts is eaſie to their very corruption, to their corrupt part.</p>
               <p>For, Firſt: There is agreement enough between any Duty they perform and their ſecret ſins, they can perform holy Duties and keep their ſins both together, and this now they find very eaſie. There is nothing in holy Duties that is againſt their ſin, yea, there is ſomthing in holy Duties that makes for their ſins, I do not ſay holy Duties in their own natures makes for their ſins, but their performing of them makes for their ſins, makes them the more quiet in their ſins. As thus, It makes more for
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:168534:97"/> their ſins, and they have more quiet in them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two Peaſons.</p>
               <p>As firſt by this means ſometimes their corruption and ſin is hidden, as you that have many Servants that are naught and vile, they will be very forward in good things, and go to Sermons, and Prayer and the like, that they might hide much of their ſin, that they might not be uſpected to be ſuch and ſuch, therefore they perform Duties of Religion; and now theſe Duties muſt needs be very eaſie to them: And ſo it is with many Hypocrites that go beyond civill men, and the Duties of Religion that that they perform, are more than civill men do, they will not only come to Church, but ſeem to be affected, not only be ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erciſed in the ordinary Duties, but in extraordinary, Faſting and Prayer, not only come to hear the word, but repeat it in their Families afterwards, not only pray here, but pray in their Families, and Cloſets, yet ſo, as to cover their corruption, to cover their very filthineſs, now theſe Duties are very eaſie.</p>
               <p>Or Secondly, which is a amore cloſe way, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſatisfies their Conſciences, their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would not be at quiet except they did ſomthing, a Man and Woman that walks in a carnall way, that hath a vile Spirit, a ſenſuall ſpirit in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant way and courſe, if ſuch a one ſhould not do ſome good thing, having ſome enlightening of mind, his Conſcience being ſomwhat awakened and ſtirred, he could not be at quiet if he did not now and then pray, and now and then come to hear the word, and deſire Sacraments, his Conſcience would fly in his face, and would not be at quiet, now having many ſecret corruptions that he is loth to part with, he is content to do ſomthing, to take a Book, and read a Chapter, and go into his Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:168534:98"/> and pray in his Family, and will not neglect the word, but come to hear the word all the Lords day, come twice, and thrice to hear the word, now all theſe things are very good, and they are to be encouraged in them, but now examin I beſeech you, whether all the good and comfort that you find is not only this, that by theſe things your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are quieted, and ſo you go on more eaſie in ſome ſinfull way, becauſe of this, you can with the more eaſe let out your heart unto the world, you can with more eaſe take liberty to ſome haunt of evil that you are conſcious of, ſome ſecret ſin, you can take the more liberty, becauſe you have been exerciſed in holy Duties at another time. I beſeech you examin your heart in this, there is a great deal of ſecret corruption in this, &amp; it is not very rare, not an extraordinary thing that I am ſpeaking of, but I fear it is an ordinary thing that I am ſpeaking of, that many people take the more liberty in ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret haunt of evil, becauſe they have been exerciſed in holy Duties at other times, they have been at fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and prayer and perhaps their hearts have been ſtirred in Faſting &amp; Prayer, but now what uſe make they of this? it is that they may be more ſluggiſh at other times, this is a curſed eaſe, an eaſe that may ſtand not only with your corruptions, but an eaſe to your corruptions, make you to go on in the way of ſin more quietly, What a horrid ſin is this? for a Man &amp; Woman to make no other uſe of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Jeſus Chriſt than this, to this end, that he may go on more quietly in the waies of ſin, now this is an abhorring thing to a gracious heart, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart finds eaſe in the way of Duty but it is more eaſie becauſe it ſtrikes at their corruptions, and mortifies their corruptions, Oh! bleſſed be God for his Ordinances, for before I came to be exerciſed in them, and had power and life in the
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:168534:98"/> uſe of them, I had eaſe in my ſin, but ſince the time I ſet my ſelf to follow God indeed in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and have had communion with God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, I thank God I can have no eaſe in my ſin, that though my corruptions ſometimes overcome me, yet by the performance of holy Duties I find it makes my corruptions more burdenſome to me, and God that knows my heart knows this, it is my deſire that I may never find eaſe in any ſinfull way, and I love all the waies of God better, becauſe they will not let me be at quiet in the waies of ſin. And this is the reaſon that you that come to the word of God, many times, you hear many things that you like well, and you love them wel, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they diſquiet your corruptions, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have quiet in your ſinfull way, therefore you ſit at home, and you wil not come to hear the word. Oh, many men, they would love Sermons, and love to hear ſuch a man, but only for this one thing, that they wil not let them be at quiet, they cannot go on fo quietly in ſome ſinfull way which their hearts hanker after, and therefore thoſe Sermons that do not diſquiet them in this kind, Oh, they love them exceedingly, it is that I have obſerved; you ſhall have many Women, ignorant People and others, when they come to hear a Sermon that hath a great deal of Latin, and quaint expreſſions in it, Oh, how they commend this, and what an excellent Sermon was this? and what an excellent Man was this? It may be ſaid of thoſe Sermons, as <hi>Bradford</hi> ſaid of the Maſs, The Maſs doth not bite, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you love it; and ſo men uſed to love the common Prayer, alas, it did not bite, they would come, and ſtand, and hear a man read out of a Book a while, this did not bite, whereas a Prayer that comes from the heart, and fearcheth into mens hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſtirs their corruptions, and therefore they do not love it. And ſo it is in regard of the
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:168534:99"/> word, let the word come to ſearch the heart, and come neer, to divide between the marrow and the bones, to come into the ſecret of the hearts of men and women then for the ſoul to love the word ſo much the more, and to ſay Oh! this is the word of God that gives eaſe to my ſoul, I find more eaſe by ſuch a miniſtry then I find by any miniſtry, this is the eaſe of a Gracious heart: but a corrupt heart wil have eaſe only in that way that is moſt ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his own luſts That is the third difference.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another difference is this, The eaſe that a corrupt heart hath in the waies of God, it is that eaſe that he hath in taking up the waies of God but by holineſs, it is in partial obedience, it is but in part of the yoke of Chriſt, it is not in all the yoke of Chriſt he can take up ſome part, ſome pieces of the yoke of Chriſt but if you come to urge him to take up all the ways of God then he crys out, what! muſt we make Conſcience of all our thoughts, of al our words, and all our actions? muſt we anſwer for every action before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt? Oh! this he counts to be hard &amp; greivous to him, he could be content with ſomthing, but to take up the ful yoke, and all the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt, that he thinks an intollerable burden; that he muſt have the ſcripture, the word of God to be the rule of all his actions, that is ſomwhat hard: But now a gracious heart finds the greateſt eaſe when he comes up unto all Gods commands, It is true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed ſaith he, I cannot come to that pitch as to obey them perfectly but yet my heart is ſo far brought off as to ſubject my ſelf to all the commands of God if at ſomtimes he yields to ſome, and then at other times unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that brings more trouble to his ſpirit, but now when he can find his heart ſubmitting to all the precepts of God, then he finds moſt reſt, all the waies of wiſdom are pleaſant. A Child of God finds
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:168534:99"/> no one thing in the waies of God that is not eaſy, and the more it comes to an univerſal obedience in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, the more eaſe it hath when indeed it doth but begin to make ſome enterance upon Gods waies, and takes up ſome duties and not all, then it finds trouble, but when it comes to take up all, and comes to yeild univerſal obedience, then it finds eaſe. Now examin your hearts in this you find it may be ſome eaſe in the waies of religion, O! but it is but partial obedience, you take this, and leave that, obſerve this, a partial obedience, is an eaſy obedience to a carnal heart, but an univerſal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is the moſt eaſy obedience to any Gracious heart.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Containeth Six differences more of the former Point 5 A Carnal heart can take up and lay down du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties when he will. 6 He hath eaſe in the remiſſneſs of his Spirit. 7 His eaſe is al alike. 8 The more eaſe he hath the more ſluggiſh he is. 9 He hath but one principle in the heart that acteth him both in the waies of God, and the waies of the world. 10. His eaſe comes from the performance of duties in his own Strength.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>Fiftly, Another is this, A carnal heart finds eaſe, from the liberty of taking up and laying down the duty, it is eaſy becauſe he can take it up and lay it down when he will, if a beaſt have a yoke that he can ſhift the collar when he wil it is eaſy, when he can put in his head when he will, and ſlip out his head when he pleaſe, this is no grievouſneſs to the beaſt, ſo it is with carnal hearts, the waies of
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:168534:100"/> God are eaſy to them, why? becauſe ſomtimes they can take up duties, and ſomtimes lay them down, when they are in a good mood, then they can take up duties, and read, and pray; and the like if any thing vex and trouble them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then they can lay them down again; and ſomtimes when they liſt they can come and heare Sermons, and when they liſt they can go into bad company, go into the Tavern, and the like; but now a gracious heart finds the greateſt eaſe when it can be conſtant in the waies of God, when I can bring my heart to this, that there is an evenneſs and proportion between what I do at one time, and what I do at another time, there is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt eaſe to a gracious heart, and indeed, there can be no true comfort in any holy duty where the heart is not conſtant, the conſtancy and the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, and the proportion that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one thing and another, is that that makes the waies of God eaſy unto the Saints. As in going in any way or common path if a man have one ledg long and another ſhort, or if the way be uneven, ſomtimes plain, ſomtimes rugged, ſomtimes down hill, and ſomtimes uphil, that is hard to a man in his walking; and ſo it is with the work of a Chriſtian, that that makes it difficult is this, Oh, I cannot find my heart in a conſtant evenneſs, were my heart ſo, then I ſhould find eaſe, but that which makes it moſt difficult, it is the unevenneſs of my heart, on the contrary, put now a carnal heart to this, to a conſtancy in any duty or work for God, O! it will cry out of wearineſs in Gods waies, perhaps he wil be content to be a while in holy duties, to hear a ſhort Sermon, and go away again, but to ſpend the whol Sabboth, that is weariſom to him; Nay perhaps he could be content to keep one Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, but to keep Sabboth after Sabboth, that is burdenſom to him, and perhaps he could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:168534:100"/> to pray one morning in his family, but to pray every morning, and every night, and to go on from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to morning, and from day to day, and from week to week, and from yeare to yeare, Oh! this is weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, truly, we have no reaſon to grudge God any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice all our daies, but thus it is with a carnal heart.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, The eaſe that a carnal heart hath, it is in his remiſſneſs in duty, in the remiſſneſs of his ſpirit, in his moderation that he pleads for, there lyes his eaſe, but for the other, the extenſion of duty, that he pleads not for; you ſhal have a carnal heart plead for holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but with moderation, we muſt be moderate, and if we do ſomthing that God requires, though we be not ſo hot and fiery as others, I hope it is wel enough, doth not vertue conſiſt in the middle way? As I like not the profaneneſs of ſome men, that are Swearers, and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, &amp; whoremongers on the one ſide, ſo I do not like your preciſe men on the other ſide, ſo that his eaſe lyes in the remiſſneſs, in the lukewarmneſs of his ſpirit in holy duties. But now the eaſe of a gracious heart lyes in the exactneſs of his ſpirit, to come to the very top of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties. It is with a gracious heart, as it is with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fowls, you ſhall have many fowls that fly, when they are low, they flutter, and it is a trouble to them to get on high, but when they are aloft, then it is no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them; ſo it is with a gracious heart, to get up his heart, is ſome trouble to him, but now when he hath got up his heart, then he is in his element, there he can fly ſwiftly, when he hath got up into the higheſt region, there he gets the moſt eaſe. It is quite otherwiſe with a carnal heart, when he pleads for moderation, this vertue of moderation that he pleads for, it is not a middle of participation, the middle in which virtu conſiſts; it is not a middle that doth participate of a degree of both the contraries, but a denying of the extreams of both, as the true virtue of liberality conſiſts not between prodigallity

<pb n="667" facs="tcp:168534:101"/> therefore thoſe duties that would lift up the heart high, thoſe are troubleſom unto him. As now, you ſhal find in ſome beaſts, a horſe that is a jade and tyred, wil go pretty well in ſome ſmoth way, but if he come to the leaſt riſing of a hill, Oh, how hard is it for ſuch a beaſt to draw? and how ready is he to ſtand ſtill? perhapps, when the way is down hill he will draw, but at no riſing or up-hil, now it is otherwiſe with a horſe of mettle, you ſhal find no difference between one way &amp; another, nay, he will go better up-hill then down hill: So it is with Carnal hearts perhaps in ſome kind of things that may be ſuitable to them, and are ſmoth they may go apace, but in that that raiſeth his ſpirit, that that is uphill, Oh, that is difficult, but now a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart, is lively, and ſpiritual, and joyful, and finds moſt quiet and eaſe when he riſeth higheſt.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, A carnal heart, the eaſe that it hath in Gods waies, it is all a like aſwel one time as at another time, it is not ſo with the Saints, they have eaſe, but they do not find it all alike when indeed they can be conſtant in Gods waies, then they find conſtant eaſe, but becauſe ſometimes they find cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption prevail then indeed the waies of God are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficult, more difficult then at other times, when they find a temptation that overcomes their hearts, they find a great deal of difficulty before they can get it off, but this will diſcover many men to be naught, when you find your corruptions prevail, you can have as much eaſe as at other times, As ſuppoſe you have been the laſt week drunk, or have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting uncleaneſs, or have been in Company, and you can come to the Sacrament on the Lords day, and joyne with the Miniſter when at prayer, you can come and put on your ſunday clothes (as you cal them) and ſit at the word, and it is as eaſy to you
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:168534:102"/> as any other thing, ſurely, now thy heart is but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, wert thou ſpiritual, if thy heart were conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ſome ſin committed the week before when thou wert in company, Oh! when thou comeſt to the word, thou wouldeſt find the word as a dagger ſtuck to thy ſoul, thou wouldeſt find the preſence of God terrible to thee, in prayer, and in the word and Sacrament: but canſt thou give way to thy ſin in the week time, and God knows that thou haſt not been humbled before the Lords day, and yet canſt thou come and joyn in prayer, and the word, and Sacrament with eaſe, this is a ſign of a carnal heart, that thou art not acquainted with God or any of his waies: but it is otherwiſe with a gracious heart, he hath eaſe, the preſence of God is comfortable unto him ſo long as he can keep his reckoning even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and his Soul, but if he ſhould give way to ſin, and draw the power of the devil upon him when he comes into the preſence of God, he finds the preſence of God terrible unto him.</p>
               <p>Eightly, Another Difference between the eaſe of a carnal heart, and a gracious, heart is this: In the effect of it there are other manner of effects that are produced by the eaſe of a Gracious heart, than of any carnall heart: As thus, A carnall heart, the more eaſe he hath, the more ſluggiſh he is, and the more barren he is; but a gracious heart, the more eaſe it hath in Gods waies, the more fruitfull it is. As we ſay of States and Kingdomes, that peace in States and Kingdomes brings plenty, and ſo it doth, we have had experience of it, ſo peace in the Conſcience of one that is Gracious makes him plentifull in all good works, a heart that is truly Godly, is never ſo fruitfull in the waies of God, as when he hath the moſt eaſe and reſt in Gods waies; but now take a carnall heart, if his Conſcience be
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:168534:102"/> troubled, Oh, then he will ſet upon holy Duties, but if he be at eaſe and quiet, he grows more barren, and more ſluggiſh, by how much the more eaſe he hath. I do not know any one thing, to help you better to exam in your own hearts in a great caſe of Conſcience than this: How do I know when I have peace and quiet, whether it comes from preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or from true Faith? I bleſs God, I have hope of Gods mercy, and ſo I have quiet in my Conſcience, well, but now here is the caſe of Conſcience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this quiet that I have in my Conſcience from the hope I have of Gods mercy, from preſumption in me, or from true Faith? It concerns every one to get this caſe of Conſcience anſwered. Now I know no greater help for the anſwering this caſe of Conſcience, than this one thing that I have ſpoken of. Haſt thou quiet and eaſe? and haſt thou hope of Gods mercy? and doth that bring thee quiet? if it be but preſumption, it makes thee ſecure, it makes thee barren, and ſluggiſh: but on the other ſide, if thou haſt eaſe and quiet in thy Spirit, and thou fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, that the more that eaſe and quiet encreaſeth, the more fruitfull thou art in all good works, it makes thee the more active and ſtirring in all good works, this is a ſign that it comes from Faith; as you heard before, a gracious heart hath the more activeneſs in it the more eaſe it hath, now as his activeneſs in goodneſs cauſeth eaſineſs in his heart, ſo the eaſineſs in his heart cauſeth activeneſs in goodneſs, there is a mutuallneſs in theſe two, and indeed this latter is the more facile for people to exam in themſelves by, perhaps every one cannot group to that activeneſs of heart, but now hath it this power upon your hearts, that you are more fruitfull than before? This is the eaſe of a gracious heart, if it doth ſo.</p>
               <pb n="670" facs="tcp:168534:103"/>
               <p>Ninthly, And then the eaſe that a carnall heart hath in the waies of God is from hence, becauſe he hath but only one principle in his heart, when he is in the waies of God, and when he is in the waies of the world, he is acted but by the ſame principle in both, there is not a contrary principle in his heart, one that carries him one way, and another that carries him another way: but the eaſe of a gracious heart, is this, that he finds a ſtronger prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that overcomes a contrary principle of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in him, there lies his eaſe, a carnall heart goes on and performes Duties, and hath not divers principles in his heart to cary him this way or that way, but hath only one principle, a carnal principle that carries him on to ſerve his own ends, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he can ſerve his ends in one thing, &amp; ſomtimes in another thing, but one that is Godly finds eaſe from hence, from the power of Gods Grace that doth overcome his corruption, I find a ſtirring in my heart, but I thank God I can get the victory, the eaſe of a Godly heart comes from the victory that it gets, but it is not ſo with a carnall heart, your civill men do not find eaſe from their victory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what they do is not ſuitable to them, but a Godly man finds that there is a principle of Grace that oppoſeth the principle of luſt and corruption, and therefore can ſay ſince I ſet my heart towards God and his waies, I have found more corruption than before ſtirring, but I thank God I have got victory over them, I find a conqueſt gotten over the corruption that is ſtirring in my Soul, and that is my eaſe, another man, he finds no corruption ſtirring in his heart, and therefore no marvell if he find eaſe, but now a Godly man finds a contrary principle to that which is good ſtirring in his heart, and then finds Gods Grace coming in upon his heart to help him againſt that corruption, and this brings eaſe and quiet to him.</p>
               <pb n="671" facs="tcp:168534:103"/>
               <p>Tenthly, And then the laſt is this, That the eaſe the one hath comes from this, that all that he doth he preformes in his own ſtrength, and he doth not ſee any need of any further ſtrength than that which he hath in himſelelf, to enable him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Duties, and ſo he finds eaſe: As a man finds his Trade to be eaſie if he trades with his own ſtock, and hath nothing but his own ſtock to trade with, and trades in no higher things then what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf can reach unto, whereas another man, that muſt have the ſtocks of other men to trade with, finds a great deal more trouble that ſees his trade re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more ſtock than his own. It is ſo with a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, he ſets upon duty ſo, as needs he finds he more ſtock than his own, his trade is beyond his own ſtrength: but now a Godly heart when he comes to want ſtrength, he fetcheth ſtrength from Chriſt, he fetcheth ſtrength from the Covenant of Grace, he fetcheth ſtrength from the Promiſe, and when he hath got ſtrength from Chriſt, from the Covenant of Grace, from the Promiſe Oh, now he finds reſt and eaſe in his Duty, and you ſhall ſee the reaſon of it in the next Point, why the Sants finds difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, many times they will think to be trading with their own ſtrength, and their own ſtocks, whenas the things they trade about is beyond their own ſtrength, but now when they can look higher and ſee a fulneſs in Jeſus Chriſt, in the Mediator of the new Covenant, and of his fulneſs we muſt receive Grace for Grace, and fetcheth ſtrength from this, Oh! then here is quiet and eaſe, when the Soul comes to trade with another ſtock. Obſerve this, you will find it as certain as can be, all thoſe that are meer civill People, that find it ſo eaſie to go on in the waies of God, they were never ſenſible of any need they have of any more ſtrength than their own, whereas the Yoke of Chriſt is heavier than
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:168534:104"/> any naturall ſtrength is able to bear, and therefore if you find eaſe, in that you have ſtrength of your own to perform it, Certainly, it is not the Yoke of Chriſt. But now, when you find your own ſtrength too ſhort, when you go to perform any Duty, and find a great deal of difficulty, you can go to Chriſt, and to the Covenant of Grace, and to the Promiſe, and there fetch in ſtrength, you have eaſe and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. Oh, that you were acquainted with this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Godlineſs, that when you go out to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Duties, and you find them difficult and hard, that then you can go out to Chriſt, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nannt of Grace, and the Promiſe, and fetch ſtrength from them to perform Duties, this is the eaſe of a Godly heart, when it finds eaſe in Gods waies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner; and all you that are acquainted with this Myſtery of Godlineſs, know that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eaſe you have found hitherto, it is not the eaſe of a Gracious heart, but rather of a carnal heart.</p>

So it is here when there are many Duties to be done, it may be you cry out; Oh, it is very hard, and how ſhall we be able to do ſuch a thing? ſuch a poor weak body as I am, how ſhall I be able to do it? but when you come to the Duty you do not find it ſo, I ſuppoſe there are many, that at firſt thought it a very difficult Duty to keep a watch over their heart, and to pray in their Families and Cloſets, and to keep cloſe to God, but when they have come to the thing, ſomtimes when you have had no heart to pray, when you have thoughts to go to prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you have thought it impoſſible for you to make any work of it, but when you have come to it, you

As now we know it is with ſome Bullocke, ſome creatures that are unruly, when they are in the yoke they keep ſuch a ſtir, and riggle this way and that way, and they are ſo unquiet when they are under the yoke, that they toil and trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abundantly more then another that can carry the yoke quietly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that goes on quietly with his yoke ſo it is with many Chriſtians when they are in the performance of duty, if they cannot do it as they would, they do ſo vex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and frett, and are ſo diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted in their ſpirits, and ſo tumultuous in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:168534:107"/> and are ready to caſt it off, Conſcience will keep it on, and they are ready to caſt it off there is ſuch a diſorderlineſs of ſpirit, and ſuch tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſpirit, this makes duties difficult, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now, when thou art in performance of duties if thou couldeſt be under the yoke of Chriſt with a calme, quiet Spirit, and carry it in a meek way, Oh! the ſweetneſs that thou wouldeſt find there, how many times ſhall you have many people, that when they go to prayer, if they cannot pray as they would do, then they vex and fret and are ready to think to pray no more, and why ſhould they pray any more? they are ſo diſturbed in the duty, they think it is better to caſt it off, and they begin to have hard thoughts of the duty, and ſo their ſpirits are all in a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtemper and diſorderly working preſently, and there is the difficulty. Whereas another, though he cannot do what he would, yet he hath an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſe to God, and thinkes I will try another time, may be God may come in another time, ſtill I love the duty, the law is good, the duty is juſt and good, and though through the untowardneſs, of my ſpirit I cannot do it now, yet I hope God will come at another time, I will do my duty, and leave it to God to come in when he pleaſeth; as you heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the Bullock or the Heifer that beares the yoke,, if he goes on quierly, his yoke is not ſo grievous, but if he flings, this way and that way, and turnes to this ſide and that ſide, every way, he makes his yoke grievous to him, and ſo it is with many Chriſtians, it is the diſorderly carriage of people under this yoke that makes it ſo difficult.</p>
               <p>Fiftly Thou complaineſt and ſayeſt this yoke is hard, conſider that the caſting of the yoke off would be a great deal harder, and therefore there is no cauſe to complain, can a man in a rational way
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:168534:108"/> complain of a yoke to be hard, whenas the caſting of the yoke off would be a harder thing then the bearing of it? therefore the Hebrew word that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies ſin, ſignifies alſo labor and trouble, there is more trouble if thou ſhouldeſt caſt off the yoke, thou wouldeſt find more diſtreſs of ſpirit, and more difficulty in caſting off the yoke, then to be under the yoke. It is true, thoſe that be carnal and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, do not find it ſo, but if thou haſt Grace, if thou ſhouldeſt caſt off the duty becauſe of the difficulty thou wouldeſt find it more difficult to be without the duty, then to perform it. As I will inſtance to your own experiences, you fiend ſometimes that your hearts are loth to come off to prayer in a morning, or if you do pray, you do it ſleightly, now do not you find your hearts off the hooks al the day long after, have not you more trouble all the day long when your conſcience tells you that you ſhould go and ſeek God and pray, I but other things are more eaſy, and that is a hard thing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you neglect it, now do not you find it more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be with out prayer in a morning, then is in all the labour of prayer? compare one day with another, and ſee which is the eaſyeſt. The yoke of Chriſt that was upon <hi>David,</hi> might be ſomwhat hard to the fleſh but the caſting <hi>off the yoke broke his bones, therefore in</hi> Pſal. 51. <hi>He cries to God,</hi> to reſtore to him <hi>the joy of his Salvation and to heale thoſe Bones of his that were broken, That the Bones that thou haſt broken may rejoyce, that expreſſion the Prophet hath,</hi> Pſalm, 51. verſ. 8. <hi>Make me to hear joy and Gladneſs, that the Bones that thou haſt broken may rejoyce,</hi> ſo that it broke the very Bones of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the caſting off the yoke of Chriſt, the trouble that <hi>David</hi> felt in his heart, it was ſuch a burden to him as broke his bones, now when did ever any duty that <hi>David</hi> performed break his bones? though
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:168534:108"/> it might a little paine his fleſh, and be a little bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom to his fleſh, yet it was not that which broke his bones, the caſting off the yoke of Chriſt is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter burden, and more troubleſom to a gracious heart then to keep it on.</p>
               <p>Sixthly. Thou complaineſt of difficulty in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in Chriſts yoke. may be it is not the yoke of Chriſt that is upon thee, that is ſo heavy upon thee, if thou examineſt it again, perhaps thou ſhalt find it is not Chriſts yoke that is upon thee.</p>
               <p n="1">1. May be it is a yoke that thou haſt taken upon thy ſelf, perhaps ſomthing that thou haſt put upon thy ſelf that Chriſt never required of thee, then it may be grievous to thee, if we will put that upon our ſelves that Chriſt never required, as Papiſts do that put that upon themſelves that Chriſt never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, who required theſe things at your hands? It may be ſome men have put ſomthing upon you that Chriſt never required of thee, it may be thou putteſt upon thy ſelf a duty at this time, that is not the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this time, but is the duty of ſome other time, when thou wilt enjoyne thy ſelf to do ſuch a duty that is not the duty of this time, but the duty of another time, then it may be troubleſom; as many poor Chriſtians are peſtered this way, when God would have them do ſuch a duty, conſcience puts them upon another duty, God calls them to a duty of their calling, but conſcience puts them upon prayer, now that is not the duty it may be of this time, and this is the way of Satan, of the Devil, to weary them, and tire them, by putting them upon duty unſeaſonably, when he cannot by temptation hinder them from duty, then he labors to weary and tire them, by putting them unſeaſonably upon duty, As I have known ſome, they could not be at
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:168534:109"/> their work a quarter of an hour, but ſuddenly they muſt leave all and go to prayer, and they thought it was the motion of Gods Spirit, and the dictates of conſcience, and they thought they muſt not neglect it, and ſo made their lives uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table upon that ground; whereas the Spirit of God puts people upon duty ſeaſonably, every thing in its right order, and right way, and in its due time, it will put you upon prayer in a fit time, and put you upon duties of your calling in a fit time, and when it comes unſeaſonably to diſquiet you, it is rather a ſuggeſtion of Satan to diſquiet you, then to make you to obey Chriſts yoke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. May be it is not the yoke of Chriſt, but meerly the yoke of the Law, as thus, though it may be the ſame thing that Chriſt would have you do, yet you may have it laid upon you in a legal way, to do it meerly out of fear of the wrath of God, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo it may be as a ſcourge to force you to it, and ſo to look upon every duty as if your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſtate depended upon it, as if you were to be caſt or ſaved by the meer performance of your duty, this is rather the yoke of the Law then the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt, to be put and hurryed upon duty, as if your eternal eſtate did depend upon your duty, and you were to be caſt in your eternal eſtate by that rather then any thing, here is the yoke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> not the yoke of Chriſt, Chriſt puts you upon duty for the honor of God, yet ſo, as the hazard of your eternal eſtate is over, and thou art not to be caſt upon the performance of the duty this way or that way, that if thou faileſt thou wert to be caſt for ever to everlaſting deſtruction upon thy failing, he doth not bring you before God as before a ſevere and revenging judg, but puts you upon ſervice, as a Child is put upon doing ſervice by a Father, now
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:168534:109"/> it is a great deale eaſyer for a child to do ſervice to a father, then for a ſlave to do ſervice to one that hath him in bondage, that will be continually laſhing him, and beating him black and blue; ſo indeed the yoke of the Law (which we are to ſpeak of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards when we come to ſpeak of the eaſineſs of Chriſts yoke) that is greivous, and many Chriſtians they do their duties meerly in a legal way, and ſo it is rather <hi>Moſes</hi> yoke, then the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo it comes to be hard; whereas when thou comeſt to underſtand what the yoke of Chriſt is, and what the duties are that are required by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and ſo to take them from him by a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, for ſo they are required, there is no duty in the Morral Law, but is required of you in the Goſpel, and in a ſtronger bond then ever it was required upon the firſt Covenant, but in another way, coming unto it in another way in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and through the hand of the mediatour Jeſus Chriſt, ſo it comes to be a great deal more eaſy, and when duties are taken up in an evangelical way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then they are eaſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſo long as you take them up in a legal way, then they come to be very grievous, that is the Sixth Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Another anſwer is this, that difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that you find, it is not the Yoke of Chriſt, if you conſider, That now Corruption is more Stirred then ever it was before, the difficulty is in the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of corruption, &amp; in the Stirring of your corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more then before, ſo that your Corruption through this, by means of the yoke of Chriſt comes to be more ſtirred then formerly it was: As thus now (ſometimes I think, I have given you this Similitude) if there be a few embers of fire that is covered under the aſhes, while no body medles with thoſe embers, the aſhes lye Still, but if you
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:168534:110"/> come to blow up theſe aſhes, the aſhes fly up and down: So it is with the Soul that hath Grace, while corruption lies ſtil all is at quiet, but when Grace comes and ſtirs corruption, that makes a trouble, you come now to ſee your ſins more, and to oppoſe them more. As when a Phyſician comes to give Phyſick, the ſtirring of the humor makes the Party more ſick, ſhould the Patient complain of the Phyſician and ſay, this Phyſick makes me more ſick, &amp; I wil take no more of his Phyſick? if the Phyſick did not make thee more ſick, it would do thee no good. And ſo when thou comeſt to the practice of Religion, if Grace do not ſtir thy corruptions, it wil not cure thy corruptions, thou comeſt to be ſenſible of thy ſin more than ever, &amp; thou art ready to think that it is the yoke of Chriſt that troubles thee, but it is the ſight and the further ſence of thy ſin that makes thee thus, and thou haſt cauſe to bleſs God for this trouble, there is nothing more ordinary than for Chriſtians that are not wel experienced in the waies of God to think thus, that they are worſe than ever, they never had ſuch thoughts, they never were troubled with ſuch blaſphemous thoughts in Prayer, they never found ſuch ſtirrings of corruption in their hearts as now they have, and they think they are declined, and they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off from God and eternal life than before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee more evil in themſelves, &amp; find more ſtirring of corruption than before, be not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by this, it is the ſtirring of thy corruption though the thing in it ſelf is evill, yet it is a good ſign, it is a ſign the word of God is working in thee, and God ſtirreth in thee, therefore do not complain of the word of Chriſt, that it makes thee worſe, but it is a meer accidental cauſe of the ſtirring of thy corruption, and it wil do thee good at the latter end.</p>
               <pb n="685" facs="tcp:168534:110"/>
               <p>Eighthly: Another Anſwer is this, The yoke of Chriſt is hard, but to what? It is hard to fleſh and blood, it is hard to the unregenerate part, it is hard unto that that ſhould endure hardneſs, it is fit that fleſh &amp; bood ſhould endure hardſhip, &amp; there is no cauſe to complain that it is hard to them, to fleſh &amp; blood, wo to thee if ſo be the waies of God ſhould prove eaſie to fleſh and blood, it is a ſign that it is the true yoke of Chriſt, becauſe it is hard to fleſh and blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is hard to that we ſhould beat down, it is hard to that that is our enemy, Is there any cauſe to complain that ſuch a thing is very difficult, hard and grievous unto our enemy? unto one that we ſhould beat down? Now it ſhould be the care of a Chriſtian, to beat down fleſh and blood as long as we live, and therefore that that is moſt hard unto fleſh and blood, that they ſhould rejoyce in, if they find it to be ſo, Should any one complain, if the City ſhould have Rebels and Traitors that ſhould riſe in the City, to have Bolts and Fetters caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them? Is not this an eaſe to a City? Doth a Kingdom or City ſuffer by this, becauſe Iron Bolts and Fetters are upon Traitors, Rebels, and Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors? What greater Traitors, Rebels, and Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors are there againſt Jeſus Chriſt, our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and everlaſting good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ariſeth up in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt Jeſus Chriſt, than fleſh and blood? and if Iron Bolts and Fetters be upon them which we ſhould ſeek to ſubdue and cruſh, why ſhould we complain of hardneſs there? Wouldſt thou have eaſe to fleſh and blood, that is a curſed eaſe, But now is not the yoke of Chriſt eaſie to the regenerate part in me? In my fleſh (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) there is no good, but the regenerate part finds an eaſe in the waies of Chriſt, and they are very ſweet, and very comfortable to the Soul.</p>
               <p>Ninthly: Thou complaineſt of difficulty, it may
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:168534:111"/> be it is becauſe thou haſt not learned the former leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Learn of me (ſaith Chriſt) for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you ſhal find reſt unto your Souls, for my yoke is eaſie and my burden is light. Art thou ure that thou haſt learned of Jeſus Chriſt theſe two leſſons that you have heard ſo much of heretofore, Meekneſs and Humility? Have you meek ſpirits, quiet ſpirits? Have you humble ſpirits, lowly ſpirits? Angry fleſh wil not endure any great burden, if you touch angry fleſh, Oh, it is a burden to it, and ſo proud fleſh, a ſwoln Leg, and ſwoln Arm, and Shoulder, and Neck, if the Neck be ſwoln it cannot bear a yoke: So the proud fleſh in thee it is that that makes the yoke of Chriſt ſo grievous, and burdenſom to thee. But now if thou haſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned throughly theſe two Leſſons, of Meekneſs of Spirit, and Lowlineſs of heart, Oh, how eaſie is every thing that Jeſus Chriſt requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es to a meek and lowly ſpirit? if once thou getteſt thy heart down, the bladder pricked, to be low in thine own eyes, and thy heart low, then every thing wil be eaſie that Chriſt requires, thou complaineſt that they are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, but it is becauſe of pride.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Another Anſwer is this: Though there be ſome kind of difficulty in the waies of God, and the Saints find it ſo yet there is more delight than there is trouble, and more eaſe than pain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare one with another, and take all together, and then it may be ſaid to be rather eaſie than any way burdenſome, and light than any way heavy. As I wil expreſs it by this ſimilitude, a ſick mans cloaths, the cloaths that a ſick man hath upon him, may be they are ſomwhat burdenſom, a man that is weak, to put on the cloaths that he was wont to weare, he feels it a burden, a paine, I but he finds more good by his cloaths then the burden comes to, his cloaths keep him from catching cold, and keeps him warm
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:168534:111"/> from the air, and ſo he finds the benefit of his cloaths more to him than the burden of his cloaths come to: So though there may be ſome burden, ſome kind of trouble in the waies of God to one that is ſanctified, being but in part ſanctified here, yet there is more delight, and more eaſe, and more good that he doth find in the waies of God than there is trouble, and therefore put all together, and then the yoke of Chriſt is eaſie, and his burden light, theſe ſeverall conſiderations will ſatisfie againſt all the difficulties that any of the Saint<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s do find in Chriſts yoke.</p>

I am verily perſwaded, that one of the greateſt things that cauſeth ſo much malignity in this Kingdome at this day, it is the fearing of the yoke of Chriſt, men are afraid of the goverment of Chriſt in his Church, they are afraid they ſhall not have that liberty for their luſts and wickedneſs as formerly, but that there ſhall be yokes to reſtrain and keep them from thoſe looſe waies that formerly they lived in, and you may ſee plainly it is ſo, who are they that joyn with the
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:168534:112"/> malignant party that have ſuch ſpirits, but ſuch as have looſe ſpirits? they are thoſe that live very looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; others that have meer civility, and know little of the power of Godlineſs, they are afraid of this, and Oh, how is it ſaid by moſt, we will not have this man reign over us? they even ſaid they will break his bonds aſunder, and caſt away his cords, that is the controverſie that it is come to at this very day, and that Prophecy in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. ſeems to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled at this day, at verſe 2. <hi>The Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſel together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, and againſt his anointed, ſaying, Let us break their bonds aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us, he that ſitteth in the Heavens ſhall laugh, the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion, Then ſhall he ſpeak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion,</hi> for al this I wil ſet my King upon my holy hil: Certainly, Chriſt is not ſet up as King as he ought to be, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver profeſſion we make, except we be willing to come in, &amp; put our necks under the yoke of Chriſt, and Oh, what a heavy burden and yoke it is? For inſtance, That Men and Women ſhould not make a meer verbal profeſſion, and ſay, I beleeve, and I hope to be ſaved by Chriſt, but ſhould give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Faith, and give an account of ſome work of God upon their hearts, that God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them out of the world, certainly, that is one thing that Chriſt doth require in his peoples joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together, to ſet up the Ordinances as they ought to be, that they ſhould have ſome knowledg one of another, knowledg of ſome work of the Holy Ghoſt upon their hearts. You will ſay, that is ſecret. I but though the Holy Ghoſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in ſecret, yet certainly, this may ſome way or other appear, we cannot know it certainly, for there may be many Hypocrites (no queſtion) in
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:168534:113"/> the Church of God, and it is a very vain cavil for men to ſay, can the Church of God be without Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites? that is taken indeed for granted, and no body in the world denies it, I but there muſt be that in the judgment of Charity, ſo as by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity we may ſee ſo far as we are able to ſee, that the Holy Ghoſt hath been working upon the Soul of this Man and Woman, and hath called them out of the world, this is the firſt thing in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming under the yoke of Chriſt in his Church. Now how hard is this to carnal hearts? the very mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, is enough to make a mutiny in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, What! have we lived al this while, and muſt we now come to give account of our faith? But now it is an eaſy thing to a gracious heart, what is more eaſy to a Gracious Heart, then to ſpeak of the work of God upon his Heart, &amp; to give Glory to Jeſus Chriſt in manifeſting the work of God in calling him out of the world, and bringing him out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkneſs, and tranſlating him into the Kingdom of his dear Son? the manifeſtation of this is exceeding delightful to a gracious Heart. And whereas many think, that ſome wil lay a greater yoke upon them by coming in, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the gouerment of Chriſt in his Church, they ſay, they wil make them to enter into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Covenant before they wil admit them. I confeſs, were it ſo, that this were urged as a thing neceſſary, that they ſhould not come in and joyn in the ordinances of Chriſt, without an explicit ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Covenant, then I cannot but acknowledg it were a yoke that I think Chriſt never laid upon his Church, not an explicit ſolemn Covenant, to urge it as neceſſary, that they cannot come and joyn in the ordinances without it, and as for my part, I know not any that urge it as neceſſary, though it is uſed it is true, becauſe it is the way of manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:168534:113"/> themſelves one way or another, and ſome way they would have for the manifeſtation of the grace of God, and of their willingneſs to joyn with them in all the Ordinances of Chriſt, ſo far as is revealed to them, and I know no other way that is urged than this, but to manifeſt the Grace of God upon the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Object.</hi> I but you wil ſay, There is more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than this, It is required that every one ſhould watch over another, a narrow watching over one another in their waies, and obſerving one another, and this is true, a carnal heart cannot do it, we were wont to have a looſe kind of way, that we lived in a Church communion one with another, and never knew one another, perhaps never ſaw one anothers face in all your lives, but when you came to the Sacrament, and whatever evil you
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:168534:114"/> had heard of one another, you never minded their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now it is true, That in the way of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, when the Saints are joyned together in that way, they muſt and ought to watch over one another, And what great burden is this to a Gracious heart? to a carnal heart it is true, all the waies of God are burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but to a Gracious heart it is an eaſe, that there ſhal not only be my own care, and the Grace of God in me to watch over me, but I ſhal have the uſe of al the Graces in the al Saints of God to watch over me, And is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hurt in this? It is an honor that God puts upon thee, that he gives not only his Angels charge over thee, but all his Saints a charge over thee likewiſe. A Prince hath a great Guard for the ſafety of his Perſon, and that is the honor of a Prince, he cannot go alone ſo as others do, but muſt go with a Guard: Now as the Prince in an outward way, ſo the Saints in a ſpirituall way, they are dear to Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore they ſhall never go up and down, but they ſhall have their Angels to have charge over them, But what have they charge over them for? it is as the Scripture ſaith, that they ſhould not daſh their foot againſt a ſtone, they have charge over your Bodies in a more peculiar way, and the Saints have charge over you in a more ſpiritual way: now that you ſhall have Angels to watch over your Bodies, and I make no queſtion but they keep Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan off from hurting of you, and then you ſhall have the Saints of God with whom you ſhall live eternally in Heaven, and they ſhall watch over you for your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good, and ſo they ſhal communicate all their Graces, and Gifts, and they are bound in Conſcience, ſo to do, and this is a great eaſe to a Gracious heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I, but you wil ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is another difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if ſo be we fall at any time, then we muſt give pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:168534:114"/> Satisfaction, if we fall into that which gives publick offence there muſt be publick Satisfaction given, for private offence we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt give private Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and Oh! this is a heavy Iron yoke to a carnal heart, if we ſhould come to ſuch a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we deſire, Oh! what a burdenſom thing would every carnal heart think it? let me look now to my walking, I cannot do as I was wont before time, let me be never ſo vile, do what I will, I could give a Proctor a little mony, or an Archdeacon, or a Commiſſary, or the like, and then let the Miniſter and the Congregation do what they dare, Oh! this is fine and eaſy to a wicked and corrupt heart. But now to come to this, that whatever you are, Rich or Poor, if you fall into ſcandalous ſins, it is not making freinds this way or that way, or to a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, no, but you muſt come and make publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, &amp; give publick Satisfaction, and this is a yoke that is hard to a carnal heart, but to a gracious heart it is eaſie. What difficulty to a gracious heart is this? I have publickly diſhonoured the name of God, and now I come publickly to repaire the name of God that I by my ſins have darkned, and done hurt unto, I come now to repaire it openly, nay, what eaſe canſt thou have till that be done? certainly, if thy heart be throughly humbled for the ſins of thy ſoul, wherein thou haſt ſinned publickly againſt God; if thou haſt ſinned ſecretly, then Chriſt requires not publick Satisfaction, but if thou haſt ſinned publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what more ſuitable to thy heart if Gracious then this? Oh! that I might publickly repaire the honor of God, that hath publickly been diſhonored by my ſin? how canſt thou ſleep, or die before thou haſt done this? I cannot poſſibly ſee how ſuch a man or woman can die quietly, and go out of the world quietly, except they have had ſome opportunity to repair the honor of God publickly, as they have

                  </gap>o a Gracious heart, the ſin indeed is a burden, the ſin is a ſhame; it is a ſhame to me that I ſhould ever diſhonor the bleſſed God, that hope to receive ſuch great ſatisfaction from God, it is fit that I ſhould come and repaire the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of this God, Oh! this is the honor of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and therefore I beſeech you have no hard thoughts of the waies of Jeſus Chriſt in his Church.</p>
               <p>And conſider yet further, for the eaſineſs of it, that Chriſt gives a charge to all his Saints, that if thou be humbled and giveſt Satisfaction, that they ſhould reſtore thee with all meekneſs, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and if there ſhould be any one that ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over thee, and any way deride and ſcorne thee certainly, Jeſus Chriſt will reckon with ſuch a one for that, and there is no ſin that goes more againſt the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, then For any one to inſult over thoſe that come in the trouble of their ſpirits to repaire the honor of God that they have impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their ſins. Chriſt requires that every one ſhould mourn with thee, as thou art ſorrowfull and lamenteſt over thy ſin, ſo they ſhould have their hearts melt for thy ſins, and ſhould endeavor to have their hearts ſenſible of thy ſins as thou art, and and they that are acquainted with the waies of Chriſt in his Church, they have found it ſo, they have found all the Congregation aſwell to fall a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and burſting ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And further, Chriſt in the goverment of his Church will not have any officer over you but whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points; indeed in a Civil State, they may appoint taskmaſters, and what officers they pleaſe, but now in a Church State, Chriſt appoints every offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and therefore all that rabble of Commiſſaries, Archdeacons, Deans, and Deanes and Chapters is gone away, for there ought to be none ſuch, and it is a great eaſe unto the Church of God to bee rid of them.</p>
               <p>And again, you are to have none forced upon you, but what you your ſelves ſhall yield unto, they cannot in a domineering way ſay, you ſhall have ſuch a Miniſter. It was enough before, that if a wench in an Alehouſe, or an Hoſtler ſhould have an uncle die, and leave them to be his heire, and an Advouſon belonged to him, this Wench that lives in an alehouſe, or an Hoſtler, Should have power to ſend any fellow that he will, if he can give account of his creed in Latin, to ſend one a
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:168534:116"/> hundred miles, or one that they never ſaw in all their lives, and they to whom he was ſent, muſt take this man to have charge over their ſouls, to depend upon this man for diſpenſation of all the ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt as long as they live together, here was a burden. But now the way of Chriſt is, that there ſhould be none that ſhould take the Charge of Souls to diſpence the ordinances of Chriſt, but ſuch as the people themſelves ſhall chooſe to themſelves, that they ſhal be ſatisfyed in before, and that they are faithful, and that they are fit by the gifts and graces of the ſpirit of God to take charge over their ſouls, and to diſpence the ordinances of Chriſt in a right way, is not this now a great deal of eaſe?</p>
               <p>And further, what a great deal of eaſe is in the waies of Chriſt in his Church, when the officer is ſuch as Chriſt appoints and you approve?</p>
               <p>And further, when they are there, they have no liberty to make any new law, but juſt as Jeſus Chriſt hath made, they cannot obtrude any thing upon you to beleeve and do, but they muſt ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt would have you to beleeve and do the ſame: Now in Civil ſtates, it is otherwiſe, there you may be required to do things that you cannot find direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the word, if it be a thing that the officer thinks reaſonable to be done, if it be not contrary to the word, it is enough, if it be a thing rational, that may ſuite with the publick good of a Country, or Kingdom, it is enough: but now, when it comes to the Church, the Church officers, it is not enough for them that there is nothing in the word againſt it, but they muſt have it out of Gods word, and this is a great eaſe, that I ſhall have nothing impoſed upon me but what Jeſus Chriſt would have me to have, and to do many other particulars might be ſhewed
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:168534:116"/> for the opening of the yoke of Chriſt, differing from the yoke of the Civil State.</p>
               <p>Yea, And Chriſt requires nothing to be done in his Church, but what he would have a Reaſon given for it, but if a Prelate did but ſit at his Table amongſt his Cups, and write but a line or two, what a diſturbance was there thereby, unto many thouſand Congregations? he never came to them himſelf, but meerly he commands, and they muſt do it. But now the commands of Chriſt are otherwiſe, whatever is required of them from Chriſt, they may require a Reaſon of it, they are to be ſatisfied themſelves in the Reaſon of the thing, and how Chriſt requires it before they ſubmit unto it. Indeed, I am not bound in a Civil State to ſatisfie my ſelf in all they do, but I may-think that they underſtand more of the Civil good than I do, but it is not ſo in a Church ſtate, the meaneſt in a Congregation is not to ſay, the Miniſters and Officers they know more than I, and therefore though I ſee no Reaſon to the contrary, I will ſubmit: Now Chriſt hath ſuch a tender care over every one of his members, that whatever they do they muſt know it themſelves, they muſt do it in Faith, they muſt know how this comes out of the word, and they muſt do it then in Faith, now what an eaſe is this? and if men did know this, how readily would they come under the government of Jeſus Chriſt? it is as great an Argument of the carnality of the hearts of men, that they having been under the yoke of Antichriſt, and now they have ſome inkling of the yoke of Chriſt, that they cry out of it, and ſay, they had rather be in the former way; juſt as the Children of <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> they deſired to go back into <hi>Egypt</hi> again, and they liked not their deliverance, but would fain have gone back to their bondage again; and hath there not been the ſame murmurings in the hearts of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they would willingly return to their former bondage?

What difficulty would there be in the waies of Chriſt in the Church? Truly, I have told you the main diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and I have dealt plainly with you in this thing, the chief difficulties in all the outcry in the world about the waies of Chriſt in his Church I have told you. Now is there any Gracious heart, (if I ſhould ſingle out any Gracious heart) that would count this a difficulty? &amp; truly, we ſhould not only think it eaſie, but we ſhould pray for the government of Chriſt, for his government is better than the government of Antichriſt. We muſt know that if we be thoſe that profeſs Chriſt, we have certainly need of all the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, and they are not inſtituted in vain, and therefore if you have not been ſenſible of them heretofore, Labor to be ſenſible now, for if you did underſtand your ſelves, you would ſee a need of them, and thoſe that have had them, they have found this yoke of Chriſt to be very eaſie, and the other yoke to be a very heavy yoke unto them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the eaſineſs of the Yoke of Afflictions for the Name of Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE are now to proceed unto another thing, and that is, The ſufferings about thoſe things that Chriſt requires: though to do thoſe things that
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:168534:117"/> Chriſt requires may ſeem to be eaſie, yet to bear and ſuffer thoſe heavy things that we read that Chriſtians did ſuffer in former times when they came under the yoke of Chriſt, and which we are like to ſuffer in the cauſe of Chriſt, now eſpecially, if the Lord ſhould let the Adverſary prevail over us, we may come to ſuffer thoſe things that would be very hard, wheras if we had liberty of Conſcience as others have, that we could go any way this way or that way, ſo as may ſerve our own turn, and be ſuitable to our own ends, we might avoid a great deal of ſuffering, but now when we come under the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt keep on in the right way, we muſt keep on in the way of ſuffering, whatever ſufferings come we muſt not decline the waies of Chriſt in the word.</p>
               <p>Now for Anſwer unto this: The Scripture doth not judg it ſo hard a thing to ſuffer for Chriſt as thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to judg it to be, ſee what the Scripture judgeth it to be, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of his ſufferings that he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 10. Therefore I take pleaſure in Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, in Reproaches, in Neceſſities, in Perſecution, in Diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake,</hi> the word is in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>I am well pleaſed,</hi> here I take pleaſure, I am well pleaſed in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Neceſſities, in Perſecutions, in Diſtreſſes, I am well pleaſed in them all: Certainly, that that a man hath a good pleaſure to, that he can be well pleaſed with, that is eaſie, a man muſt needs have eaſe in a thing that he is well pleaſed in, now the Apoſtle profeſſeth that he is well pleaſed in that which he ſuffered for Chriſt, and we are never like to be called to ſuffer ſo great things as he ſuffered.</p>
               <p>And as the Scripture ſets out ſufferings as thoſe things that a man may be well pleaſed in, ſo likewiſe we may rejoyce in them. That place in <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 23. there our Lord Chriſt would have his Diſciples when they
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:168534:118"/> met with hardſhip, to rejoyce in it, <hi>Rejoyce</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in that day,</hi> yea, to rejoyce exceedingly; that is the third degree, rejoyce, and leap for joy: when is this? it is when they ſhal be ſeparated from their company, and they ſhal be reproached for Chriſts ſake, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce ſaith he, and leap for joy. Yea, the Scripture ſets out our ſufferings for Chriſt, our ſuffering that we meet withal any way in the waies of Chriſt, as that wherein above al things we may rejoyce, there is wel pleaſing, there is joy, and exceeding joy, even to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, yea, and there is al kind of joy, all joy; ſo the Apoſtle in <hi>James 1. 2. My Brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</hi> and among other temptations, theſe are great ones, the temptations of ſufferings, count it al joy. Yea, and laſtly, there is the glorying in them: ſo in <hi>Rom. 3. 5. We glory in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:</hi> ſurely then there is not ſuch difficulty in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Chriſt, if there be wel pleaſing, and joy, and exceeding joy, and all joy, and glorying: Thus the Scripture ſets out our ſufferings for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo I might give you the examples of abundance of Martyrs, that found a great deal of eaſe in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Chriſt, the example of <hi>James Bainham,</hi> in the Book of Martyrs, when they kindled the fire under his feet, ſaith he, me thinks you ſtrew Damask Roſes under my feet, truly, there is ſweetneſs enough in the Roſes that are ſtrewed under ones feet, that ones feet go upon. And ſo <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaking of a Martyr, he ſaith, that he did account the Priſon that he was in, as a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Garden, &amp; the ſeveral kinds of Tortures that he was put unto, as ſeveral ſorts of ſweet flowers in the Garden, ſo delightful were they to him. And <hi>Luther</hi> reports of one <hi>Agaba</hi> a young Virgin, that when ſhe went to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom ſhe went as if ſhe went to Marriage, &amp; to a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet. And the ſtory of Mr. <hi>Sanders,</hi> that excellent Martyr is famous, when he came to ſuffer, he found ſuch an iſſuing and going of his heart into all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his body, and from all the members of his body
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:168534:118"/> to his heart again, an intercourſe as it were in a bodily way. And it were endleſs to name you the particulars, and to ſhew wherein even the eaſineſs of ſuffering for Chriſt appears, but I ſhal not do this at large, ſome of you may ſee that in your hands of <hi>Moſes, counting it grater riches to ſuffer for Chriſt than to enjoy all the treaſures of</hi> Egypt, and a man counts not his riches a burden: Now this is the judgment of <hi>Moſes</hi> that had the Spirit of God in him, that whereas he might have had any riches that might have been enjoyed in all the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet he accounts the ſufferings with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God greater Riches than all the Treaſures of <hi>Egypt</hi> Oh! there is the higheſt improvement of our ſufferings for Chriſt as can be, ſomwhat higher im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of our ſufferings than Angels are called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Angels are not called to ſuch high improvement of their abilities for God, as when a Chriſtian ſuffers for Chriſt, there they do confeſs with a glorious Voice. Saith an Ancient concerning the Martyrs in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times. We do abundance of ſervice in a little time then, and never have the Saints ſuch a Spirit of glory reſting upon them, as in the time of ſuffering, they are under moſt glorious promiſes in thoſe times, and have more glorious comforts in thoſe times, than at other times; and ſo in ſuch reſpects, and divers others that might be mentioned, there is a great deal of eaſe and contentment in their ſufferings for Jeſus Chriſt. I was in priſon til I got into priſon for Chriſt, ſaith one Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. And many profeſſed that they never knew the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, between the comforts of the world, and the comforts of God, ſo much as then when they ſuffered. Saith <hi>Ignatius,</hi> when the wild beaſts cruſht his bones between their teeth, Now I begin to be a Chriſtian. And another profeſt he had rather be a Martyr than work miracles; and therefore there is no ſuch difficulty or heavy burden in ſuffering for Chriſt as ye are afraid of. Many poor Chriſtians, when they hear what things others have ſuffered, they think, Oh, if I ſhould be
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:168534:119"/> called to ſuffer ſuch things, I ſhould never go through them: Be not diſcouraged, the more ſenſible thou art of thy weakneſs, the better: Poor women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that have been afraid to ſuffer as well as you, when they have come to ſuffer, it hath been given to them to ſuffer, a mighty preſence hath come from Jeſus Chriſt upon them, and it hath been eaſie to them; indeed the thing that is difficult to one that is weak, is eaſie to one that is ſtrong: Now when you come to ſuffer for Chriſt, there comes in a great deal of ſtrength from Chriſt, and therein you will find eaſe; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Chriſt never calls us to do hard things, but he will give us ſtrength proportionable; and then that which appeared more difficult, will appear more eaſie than before.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>What the things are that makes the waies of Chriſt eaſie (which is the fourth point in Chap. 139.) opened in five particulars. 1. They are ſuch as a gracious Soul wil impoſe upon himſelf. 2. He comes freely off to them. 3. The waies of Chriſt are even, and not contrary one to another. 4. They bring Strength with them. 5. In them all there is good Succeſs. 6. In them a gracious heart is alwaies receiving his wages. 7. He hath all the paſſages of Gods providence to help him. 8. They bring eaſe to the Conſcience. 9. They free the Soul from cares. 10. They make all other things eaſie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt now we are to proceed to a further thing to ſhew you what there is in the way of Chriſt that makes it eaſie, which wil be a further manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the eaſe that there is in the waies of Chriſt that it is ſo, that hath been ſhewed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore!: but now that it muſt needs be ſo, and how it comes to be ſo, how it comes to paſs that the waies of Chriſt ſhould have ſuch eaſe to a gracious heart, Certainly, there is a great many Grounds for it.</p>
               <p>Firſt: They are ſuch waies as have much in them, that if a gracious heart were put to it freely, that he may either impoſe them upon himſelf or not, he would rather impoſe them upon himſelf than otherwiſe, ſuppoſing him to be himſelf; that is, his mind enlightened and his heart in a good frame, he would take them upon himſelf, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:168534:120"/> this is no hard thing, that if a man were left to his liberty he will take it upon himſelf rather than not. Let any Chriſtian lay this to his heart and conſider what way of Jeſus Chriſt he would be without, every gracious heart is a Law to himſelf, that Law is not a very hard Law that a man would make to himſelf, ſo the Scripture ſaith of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they <hi>are a Law to themſelves,</hi> a Godly heart chooſeth the waies of Chriſt, not as one chooſeth the leſs evil of the two, ſo you may ſay he may chuſe them as the leſs evil, for he may be put to chuſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but I ſay, if he were left free &amp; not put to it of neceſſity, if there were neither Hel nor Heaven, I do not know any thing in the waies of Jeſus Chriſt and dare chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any one to tel me, that if there were no Hel o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Heaven that any thing is in the waies of Chriſt but he would chooſe them: What is there that Chriſt requires of any Soul, but without any ſuch conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſuch a heart would chuſe? Would not he go rather according to the rules of equity and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs than iniquity and injuſtice? Is it not better to walk according to the rules of right reaſon, than to walk in irrational waies? But then a Beleever one that hath Faith, acts from a Principle above Reaſon, a Principle that is ſupernatural, and look as one that is a rational creature, would chuſe thoſe things that have the moſt agreement with the rules of right reaſon, ſo one that hath a higher principle a divine Principle, he would chuſe that that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles of Divinity, according to the Divinity (as I may ſo ſay) that he hath in his heart; Yea, Afflictions, when we bring our hearts to Gods will, have no great burden in them, but are eaſie, but they are not ſo eaſie as Gods waies are for Afflictions, though they come to be eaſie, yet they are ſuch, as if a Godly heart were put to it, he would, and he ought rather to chooſe to be without them. Here is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:168534:120"/> between Afflictions and Duties, that if God would ſet a gracious heart free, he ſhould chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be without afflictions though it is true, in regard of the good that God brings about in them, ſo they are good, but in themſelves they are evil, and ſo a Godly man ſhould rather deſire to be without them but now, for the duties of religion &amp; Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there we are not to deſire &amp; wiſh to be without them, or that they were otherwiſe then they are, A gracious heart is not to wiſh any command of Jeſus Chriſt to be otherwiſe then it is, and when at any time you find ſuch a riſing in your hearts, as to wiſh that ſuch a thing were not a duty, know, that now temptation comes and corruption ſtirrs. You may not do it perhaps, but you may have a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtir ſo farr, as to wiſh it were otherwiſe, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this is a great temptation, when the heart is in a right frame, it would not wiſh any thing in the waies of Chriſt otherwiſe then they are, if he were left to himſelf, he would himſelf chooſe them. That is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly When he hath choſe them, this makes them eaſy becauſe they are ſuch waies as himſelf comes freely on unto, what a man <hi>comes freely on unto that is eaſy, and all the people</hi> of God are a willing people in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. Now when he comes freely on, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, you will ſay, a man may come freely on to a thing, yet when he is come on, he may find more difficulty then he thought of. Therefore in the ſecond place they are eaſy in this reſpect, becauſe they are ſuitable unto the temper and diſpoſition of a gracious heart, ſuch a one finds the waies of Chriſt very ſuitable and agreeable to him. Now <hi>Similis Simili gaudet,</hi> every like thing doth rejoyce in that which is like, a Godly heart finds the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpane (as I may ſo ſpeak) of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt written in his own heart, that as it was in the firſt creation, there the Law of God, the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, it was written in the heart of man fully,
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:168534:121"/> and that that we have written in ſcripture, it is but as it were an extract and counterpaine of what was written in the heart of man in the firſt creation, now by ſin a great part of it is blotted out, but now when the ſoul comes to Jeſus Chriſt, then Chriſt writes again the Law of God in the heart of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, writes it faire out againe, &amp; writes the Law as it comes to be Evangelical, in an evangelical way, for ſo it is, the Goſpel comprehends all that holyneſs that was in the Law before, the ſame holyneſs that was in the Law, the Goſpel that takes it in, and makes it more compleat, and raiſeth it up higher, and makes it more ſpiritual, and hath more of God in it, and doth ſhew us how to enjoy God in a higher, better, and fuller way, that the Law of the Goſpel is written in the heart of beleevers as the Morrall Law was in the heart of <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt was, when he was made, and the Law of the Goſpel takes in the holineſs of Gods Law, and adds a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritualneſs, and ſhews a higher way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God then before was, when man at firſt was created, now therefore it muſt needs be eaſy in that reſpect It is eaſy for a fiſh to ſwim in the water, and it is eaſy for a bird to fly in the aire, for it is their own element, ſo the waies of the Goſpel are the proper element of a true godly, &amp; gracious heart And as we ſay, <hi>nullum corpus grave in ſuo loco<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> no ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is heavy in his own proper place. It is true, the waies of Godlyneſs is a heavy burden to a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart, Why? becauſe he is not in his element, when he is in holy duties, and ſanctifying the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, he is not in his element, when he is in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed company, drinking, and Swearing, then he is in his element, but now that which is your elements is but ſand to a Godly heart, and that is the reaſon that you think that ſuch Godly people are dump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and heavy, and Melancholy, becauſe they are not merry as you are, it is becauſe of your compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they are not in their element, when they are
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:168534:121"/> amongſt company that they can converſe withall, and talk of Godlyneſs, and ſhewing and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one anothers hearts, and telling the experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods working in their hearts one to another, and ſo breathing graces one upon another, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with another, then they can be as merry, and be as delightful in ſuch things as you can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your companions, ſwearing, rioting, and the like, you think it is impoſſible they ſhould be ſo, but it is ſo, that is their proper element, as the other is your element, and therefore it is as eaſy for a Saint to go on in the waies of religion, as for a fiſh to ſwim in the water, ſo farr as the regenerate part prevails, all Satisfaction flows from a ſuitableneſs between the faculty and the object, now the waies of God are the moſt ſuitable things to a gracious heart that can be, therefore there is a great deal of eaſe in them, there is nothing required in them but he <hi>finds it in his heart before it is required. It is ſaid in</hi> Prov. 18. 2. Of a fool, that he doth not receive the way <hi>of Wiſdom, the inſtruction of Wiſdom,</hi> it is in your books, a fool hath not delight in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that his heart may diſcover it ſelf, <hi>but I find it tranſlated in</hi> the old vulgar Latin, that a fool receives not underſtanding, receives not what you ſay to him, except thoſe things that are in his heart be ſpoken, except you ſpeak to him ſuch things as are in his heart, ſo they turn it, and ſo it is true in this, ſpeak to any man any thing, if there be not a principle in his heart, to cloſe with the thing that you ſpeak, he will not eaſily receive it, therefore a fool will not receive that which you ſpeak to him of, becauſe it is not ſuitable to his heart. But now a Godly man, when you ſpeak to him the things of God, and what the waies of Chriſt are, ſuch a man receives them, becauſe you ſpeak to him that that is in his heart, it is in his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:168534:122"/> you ſpeak to his heart, and he finds ſomwhat in his heart that comes preſently to cloſe with it, which makes it eaſy, there is in his heart ſuch a principle, as upon mentioning any thing of the waies of Chriſt, he cloſeth with it, and takes hold upon it, there being the ſame thing in his heart, for though there be an object ſeen, except there be ſomething in the eye ſuitable to the object to cloſe with it, there would be no ſight, ſo the heart of a Chriſtian makes the waies of God eaſy, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbraceth them, becauſe there is ſomthing in the heart that is like to Gods waies, and therefore it is ready to receive and cloſe with them. As now if you bring fire to a ſtick that hath ſome fire in it, as ſoon as ever you bring the fire, the fire that was in the ſtick before, will come out to the other fire that you bring neare to it, and will joyne together and ſo grow into a flame. If you bring a candle that hath ſome fire remaining upon it unto a fire, it lights preſently, ſo it is with the heart of a Godly man, a gracious heart ſets before him the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the waies of God, now there is a holy princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a principle of holineſs in the heart that comes out unto what is ſaid in the word of the waies of God, and ſo cloſeth with them: I, theſe are the things that I find in my heart; now theſe things muſt needs be eaſy, becauſe they are the very element of a gracious heart, and they are ſuitable to his heart, there is a freeneſs to chuſe, That is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another thing that makes them eaſy is this, The waies of Chriſt, there is an evenneſs in them, there is a proportion in all the waies of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, there is not one thing contrary unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, but every thing helps one another, and ſo they come to be eaſy. You know in other things, when
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:168534:122"/> you are going in any path where there lyes things, to interrupt you, there lyes a great deal of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in your going, but when the way is ſo laid, as that there is no one thing in it but helps to another, if you take one ſtep that helps you to another, and that ſtep helps you to another, and ſo there is ſuch an evenneſs and proportion as one helps to another If you be drawing a thing that one link helps ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one lets into another, this makes it eaſy, when every action of a mans work is ſuch, as the firſt makes the ſecond eaſy, and the ſecond the third, and the third the fourth, that work muſt needs be eaſy; ſo in all the waies of Jeſus Chriſt, one duty lets in another; and this is the difference between one that is truly acquainted with the waies of religion, and an Hypocrite, the one, when he ſets upon one duty, that one duty ſo tires him, that he hath no mind to another, but now a godly heart, one duty doth but let him in another, by perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one duty, he is fitted to another duty, and this is a ſign you performe duty in a right way, when it is thus with you, it is true, the outward man may be tired, but yet the heart is in a better frame to performe duty the next time, one duty is an in let into another, and helps on the other, that is a Third.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The waies of Chriſt they are eaſy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bring ſtrength with them, and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſtrength, certainly, that work muſt needs be an eaſy work that a man gets ſtrength by his work, and the more he works the more ſtrength he gets. It is true, great works come to be difficult, becauſe you do not only not get ſtrength, but you ſpend ſtrength, but now the waies of religion, the more you work, the more ſtrength you have, and the more work you do, the more ſtrength comes in. It
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:168534:123"/> is true, the natural ſtrength may be ſpent, I but there is inward ſtrength comes in &amp; encreaſeth, and is ſupplied by Jeſus Chriſt: the Body that carries the Soul, I but the Soul is no burden to the Body, the Soul ſupports the Body, and enables the body to move and makes it lighter, if the Soul were gone, the body would be a heavy lump, heavier than when the ſoul lives in it, ſo ſuch a kind of burden is the waies of Religion to a gracious ſoul, no other burden than the ſoul is to the body, when the ſoul is there, it is no burden, but it rather helps the Body, it makes the Body lighter and ſo when any work of Grace is added more than before, the burden comes to be lighter, and eaſier. In <hi>Prov. 10. 29. The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright,</hi> their very way is ſtrength, ſurely then their way is eaſie, that which is ſtrength, cannot be a hard way, now the way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright, an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite indeed, if he wil meddle with the way of God, he is tired, as thoſe in <hi>Malachi,</hi> What a wearineſs is the waies of God to them? I but it is to an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, but the way of the Lord is ſtrength to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. A man that hath a carnal heart, he is tired preſently, you that complain for want of ſtrength, and you have no heart to ſet about Duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, becauſe you ſay you are weak, the more ye ſet about theſe Duties, the more ſtrength you ſhall have. There is many a Man and Woman, that praies away their ſtrength in prayer, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens their ſin in prayer, and I ſhewed you, how to carnal hearts their very duties may be eaſie to their ſins, but now a gracious heart doth not pray away his ſtrength, but he ſhal have more ſtrength in his Soul for the preſent, and he ſhall ſee it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. You wil ſay, How ſhall I know that? for my body is weary and tired, if you get but a litle time to refreſh your body with ſleep, or the
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:168534:123"/> like, when you come to prayer again, you wil have more ſtrength to the Duty, there was more ſtrength in your Spirit then when you were in the Duty, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your natural ſtrength did fail, and therefore do as much as you can in holy Duties, do not fear tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs in them, you will do more than you did before. That is the fourth thing that makes them to be eaſie, becauſe they beget ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: They muſt needs be eaſie, becauſe that in all the waies of Religion there is ever more good fucceſs, a gracious heart evermore finds ſucceſs in the waies of Godlineſs, now that way that a man alwaies hath ſucceſs in, is very eaſie to him, you count that work very eaſie work that alwaies thrives in your hand, and that you may certainly, know that it wil ſucceed before you go about it. If a man go about a work, and he is uncertain in the ſucceſs, and he thinks; I may take a great deal of pains, but I know not how I ſhall ſpeed, Oh, that is tedious, I but now, when he goes out to the work of the Lord, where he knows he ſhal never fail of ſucceſs, this work is very eaſie to him, In the firſt <hi>Pſalm</hi> it is ſaid, that a <hi>Godly man proſpers in every thing that be doth,</hi> whatever he doth ſhall proſper, it is true, we may ſet upon outward things and not have ſucceſs, but there was never any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious action ſince the beginning of the world but had ſucceſs, here is the difference between your outward imployment, and your gracious imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, your earthly and your ſpiritual imployment in one, though we work never ſo well according to the Rules of our Art, yet there wil not be ſucceſs in what we do alwaies, but now let us perform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holy Duty, we ſhal never loſe any action, though we may not ſee it, yet we ſhal certainly proſper in it; and therefore there is a great deal of eaſe.</p>
               <pb n="712" facs="tcp:168534:124"/>
               <p>Sixthly: A great deal of eaſe muſt needs be in Gods waies, becauſe that a gracious heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually receiving his wages in all his work: Now that is a very eaſie work, ye ſhal not need be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the day and receive no wages at night, but a Godly man is receiving his wages continually while he is working. In 1 <hi>Pet. 9. Receiving the end of your Faith, the Salvation of your Souls,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the end of your Faith, he doth not ſay, that ye ſhal hereafter receive the end of your Faith, but ye are now receiving, every moment in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duty ye perform, you are receiving the end of your Faith, there is no holy action but there is ſomwhat of the Glory of Heaven in it, and the Soul doth receive ſomwhat of the Glory of Heaven in every holy action, ſo that he ſhall not need to ſtay for Heaven hereafter, that indeed were enough one would think to make any of the waies of God eaſie, the beleeving the Glory we ſhal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after have in Heaven, it were enough to make any journey eaſie, that we ſhal have a Crown at the end of it, but it is not ſo with the Saints, they have not eaſe becauſe they know that they ſhal have Glory hereafter, but they have a Heaven while they are doing their holy Duties, therefore are eaſie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their end, as many things may be eaſie in regard of that that comes afterwards, and ſo may be good in regard of the good which is to come, but the actions of Religion are part of the happineſs, and of the Glory of the Soul, and if we were well principled in this, it would be a great means to help us to go on with a great deal of eaſe in the duties of Religion: That it is the happineſs and Glory of our Souls, and the perfection of holineſs is our higheſt end, the Angels have no higher end than the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Holineſs. In <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10. ver. 11. <hi>Ephraim is a Heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the
<pb facs="tcp:168534:124"/> Corn, Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aim</hi> counted that an eaſy worke to tread out the corne, the meaning is this, the Cattel in thoſe times, ſome were uſed to plow the ground, and others to tread out the corn, Now thoſe that were plowing, they were abroad in the fields, and indured the ſtormes, and all the while eate nothing til they come home, and then they eate, But now thoſe cattel that were treading out the corne, all the while they were treading out the corne, and working, they were feeding upon the corn, now ſaith God, <hi>Ephraim</hi> is a tender delicate thing, he doth not love to go all the day to his work, and receive his wages at night, but he loves to tread out the corn, he loves to receive his wages conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in his work. Thus it is with a Godly heart he is upon the receiving hand continually and his work is but as the treading out of the corn, rather then plowing. That is the Sixth.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The waies of God muſt needs be eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe let a man ſet upon the waies of Godlineſs, and every thing in the world ſhall help him, no paſſage of Gods providence but ſhall help him, no creature but ſhall help him, no ordinance but ſhall help him, nay thoſe things that ſeem to go quite contrary they Shal help him; now it is eaſy to go when all things help one, when wind and Tide help you. I but you will ſay, may be we may meet with a contrary wind, I but when that contrary wind ſhal help you, as I have ſeen ſome that have made uſe of a contray wind, So it is with Godly people, all all good things help and encourage them, and ill things are turned by God to be helpful to them, and to be good to them, Yea, many have found help in the waies of God, by the ſtrongeſt temptation that they have met withall in their very faces, Yea, ſomtimes that God turnes
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:168534:125"/> their ſins, their ſtepping out of the way to be helps unto them, their very falls, as a man when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in his way, it makes him go the ſofter, you wil put your Horſe out upon his ſtumbling, and make him go the faſter, God turnes the worſt things of al to the People of God to help them in their way, ſo that by Grace now, we do not only help our ſelves ſo, as to keep off the hinderances to other things, we do not overcome the world (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have ſaid) thus to keep our ſelves from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt by it, but to make all things uſefull and ſerviceable to our graces, and that is the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of a Chriſtian, that he can by grace make all things in the world ſerviceable to his grace, that is the glory of grace, it ſhews that grace is of a royall breed indeed, that it can bring all things to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to its end, therefore the waies of God are eaſie, becauſe all things are helpfull to the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of a Child of God in thoſe waies.</p>
               <p>And further, If a man were going in a way, and there were many ſtones lay in the way, it would be rough going, and uneaſie, but were they laid in that faſhion that they ſhould be laid in a ſlough, in ſuch a place that it ſhould help me to ſtep over ſuch a ſlough then it would be more eaſie: Now here is the difference between wicked and Godly men, God in his juſt judgment laies ſtumbling blocks in the plaineſt waies of Godlineſs, ſo as to hinder wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men in waies that are good, to the wicked I ſay, wicked men, they meet with ſtumbling blocks in plain waies, in waies that are the beſt waies; but now God is plealed to lay ſtumbling blocks in the waies of ſin to the Godly, to hinder them from going on in the waies of ſin, he takes all the ſtumbling blocks that were before in the waies of ſin, and laies them in their way to Heaven. As now if there be divers
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:168534:125"/> paths to go to a place, thoſe that would give marks to others that they might not go out of the way, they dig a ditch or lay ſomwhat in the way, perhaps ſome boughs of Trees or the like, to keep them off that they may go in the right way, So when the Lord ſees any thing that lies in the waies of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that may occaſion ſtumbling to them, he takes them away, and laies them in ſuch a place that may keep them from going out of their way, and if there be any ſlough, he takes the ſtones, and laies them to help them over the ſlough, and therefore the waies of God muſt needs be eaſie.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, They muſt needs be eaſie, becauſe they bring ſo much eaſe to the Conſcience, they bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of eaſe to the Conſcience of a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; When hath any man or woman eaſe to their conſciences, but when they have gone in the waies of Religion? though before they had throbs of conſcience, and terrors of conſcience, an angry conſcience. Thou couldeſt never lie down to ſleep, but thy conſicence was as it were a hard ſtone to thy head, and as pricks in thy ſide, but now when thou art got into the waies of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou canſt lie down in the boſome of a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Father in peace, and thy conſcience very eaſie, and thy ſoul eaſie, thou feeleſt no more of the throbs of conſcience that thou waſt wont to feel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the waies of God bring eaſe to thy conſcience. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you love your eſtates, becauſe you can have means coming in when you are old, and you can ſit in a Chair, and can have maintenance brought in unto you, Oh, but if that be good, what is it to have quiet and eaſe in your conſciences, which only the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt brings in? and therefore the waies of Jeſus Chriſt are eaſie.</p>
               <pb n="716" facs="tcp:168534:126"/>
               <p>Ninthly: The waies of Chriſt are eaſie, becauſe they bring eaſe and freedome from al cares, al your troubles and cares, all your carking cares you have hereby eaſe from under them, come once under the yoke of Chriſt, and then you have nothing to do but to make known your requeſts to God, you need not care what ſhal become of you, either for the preſent or for erernity, if you be once got into the yoke of Chriſt. Do not miſtake me, to think that if once you come to profeſs religion you need take care for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, No, But I ſay, from al carking cares, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome cares, you may be delivered from them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as ever you come into the waies of Chriſt; many Chriſtians have it at the firſt, and if not at firſt, yet if you continue in them, you may come to have ſo much ſatisfaction in them, that any carking care that may cauſe trouble to your ſouls, in regard of your outward or inward, your preſent or eternal eſtate, all will be gone, for whatever you would take care for to help you, it is taken care for you there. <hi>Luther</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion I remember, A Chriſtian may keep a perpetual Sabbath all his life, and all the week long, any thing that you would have to help you otherwiſe, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wil take care for you that you ſhal have it in himſelf, you ſhal have all in himſelf. We have a place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> for the encouragement of the people of God, in <hi>Iſa. 30. 7.

A Servant now, if he have not grace in his or her heart, if the Maſter or Miſtreſs do not pleaſe them, they go about their works, and fret and vex themſelves. But now thoſe that have grace, and know that they are in the way that Chriſt would have them, and that they obey Chriſt, and ſerve Chriſt in that way, they can find abundance of eaſe, for I am ſerving Chriſt in this work, though the work is a low work, a poor work, yet I am about Chriſts work, I am ſerving Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo they go about it with eaſe. And thus the waies of Religion make every thing eaſie, our lives eaſie, and our death eaſie, our paſſage out of this world wil be eaſie too.</p>
               <p>But there are two or three things more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; the yoke of Chriſt is eaſie in regard of the yoke of the Law, therefore ſaith Chriſt in the Text, <hi>Take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is eaſie,</hi> the yoke and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage you were under in reſpect of the Law, that was a burden, but my yoke is eaſie. And it is eaſie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Antichriſt, that was ſpoken prophetically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but now we may open the yoke of Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that. But then compare it with the yoke of ſin, then it is eaſie too, the yoke of Chriſt not only in regard of all the former yokes, but if you compare it with the yoke of the Law, the yoke of ſin, and the

               <argument>
                  <p>The Yoke of Chriſt eaſier than the Yoke of the Law: For, 1. The Ceremoniall Law required abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from the comfort of the Creature. 2. Its Service was chargeable. 3. The Ceremonies were beggarly Rudiments.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE waies of Chriſt are eaſie.</p>
               <p>Firſt: In regard of the yoke of the Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly: In regard of the yoke and burden of ſin.</p>
               <p>For the eaſineſs of Chriſts waies, in compariſon
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:168534:128"/> of the yoke of the Law, you know what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. That the Law it was a <hi>Yoke, which our Fathers nor we were neither able to bear.</hi> Even the Ceremonial Law, the way of Chriſt is eaſie in reſpect of that.</p>
               <p>For Firſt: The Ceremonial part of the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired abſtaining from the comforts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the People of the Jews in the times of the Law were forbidden the uſe of many Creatures that we have a great deal of uſe of now; this is one eaſe that we have by Jeſus Chriſt, that we are to make uſe of all the Creatures, we need make no queſtion for Conſcience ſake of the uſe of any Creature, in the world, that is ſomwhat eaſier than to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from this Creature and the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And then, Secondly: We have a great deal of eaſe in reſpect of the Jews that were under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Ceremonial Law, becauſe that their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it ſelf was very chargeable to their outward eſtates, their Sacrifices that they did offer up to God, How chargeable was it? What a great part of the eſtates of men did go forth, partly in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their Levites? There is a great deal of murmuring now for a little Money for maintenance of Miniſters, but there if the account be ſummed up, the maintenance of the Levites was a great part of their eſtates, not barely the tenth of their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They had their Cities, divers, forty or more Cities that were theirs for their poſſeſſion. And many things might be ſhewed that way, the mighty charge that they were at for the ſervice of God ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral waies, not Tithes only, but Cities and the like; now God hath in a great part eaſed us of thoſe things that he required, of the People of the Jews, there is nothing now required but what is in moral equity, what is in common reaſon due to the Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:168534:128"/> for his work, only ſomwhat is due by that Scripture, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn,</hi> ſo that all the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance now for the work of God is due in a way of common reaſon, but there was other things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſervice of God in the times of the Jews, and that is an eaſe that is very ſuitable to many men, to have eaſe that way from their outward ſervice, yet certainly, the Lord (as we ſhal hear more by and by) requires of us more ſervice other waies.</p>
               <p>And then Thirdly, In the ceremoniall Law, there the very ſervice of God had a kind of burden in it, for there were ſo many external performances, that the Holy Ghoſt cals them beggarly Rudiments, ſo many outward ceremonies, outward things, that were a burden to the outward man, and they were mean things, and childiſh things, in compariſon of the Goſpel, they are called by the Apoſtle <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Rudiments:</hi> And truly, one would think, that when we ſhall read ſuch a Scripture as that, that ſhall call the ceremonies of the Law beggarly rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that were the ceremonies appointed by God himſelf, and yet when they came to be abrogated they were called but beggarly rudiments, one would admire how it is poſſible that any one that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſtianity, ſhould come and conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſo many ceremonies as they have done, to ſuch beggarly rudiments; certainly, theſe muſt needs be beggarly rudiments much more, and what a ſtrange paſs were we brought into, that we ſhould count ſuch things the great Ornaments of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whenas God did not require them but at that time, and that they are ſo vilified by God now. But inventions are never required by God, and therefore they are to be accounted more vile, and
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:168534:129"/> it is a great mercy to be delivered from the bondage of the outward ceremonies of the Law, though ſuch things as were once appointed by God, to ſpend ſo many daies as they did from their outward buſineſs, this is ſomwhat, Surely, if it were in mans power to appoint ceremonies, and make daies holy as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did undertake heretofore, we had been brought into a greater bondage than ever the Jews were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, but Chriſt would have eaſe in the outward adminiſtration of his worſhip.</p>
               <p>And then likewiſe, though God hath appointed ſome outward things, yet very few, for the outward part of his vvorſhip, What a few things are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Jeſus Chriſt? vvhereas in the times of the Law, there vvere multitudes of external things, yea, and how eaſie are they that Chriſt hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the outvvard part of his vvorſhip; whereas in the times of the Lavv it vvas hard, as circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, vvhat a hard thing vvas it to have to foreskin of the fleſh cut off? and you knovv it made them ſore, vvhen the men of <hi>Sichem</hi> vvere circumciſed, they vvere ſo ſore, that two or three men vvere able to deſtroy a vvhol City, novv Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no ſuch hardneſs of us.</p>
               <p>And truly that may be one thing that may make us much doubt of the waies of many that put people upon ſuch vvaies, as in the Winter time to go into Rivers, and venture their healths &amp; lives as they do, certainly, Chriſt requires no ſuch thing, if Chriſt did require ſuch a thing, I dare appeal to any to give me any one place in the old Teſtament vvhere there is a harder commandment than that, if that vvere a commandment then Chriſts yoke in that one thing is harder than any one thing that Chriſt required of the Jews, no one Duty ſo difficult to the outward man as that thing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, now certainly the yoke of Chriſt as he himſelf ſaith, it is but eaſie, it is not
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:168534:129"/> hard to the outward man in ſuch external ſervices, Chriſt did not change one Ordinance from another to make it harder, there is no Ordinance that Chriſt did change from the Law to the Goſpel to make it harder, and there is no mercy that is allowed in the times of the Law, but is allowed in the times of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And further, That is another Argument that is very perſwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive to the Beleever and his children, for if God ſhould deny this condition to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the times of the Goſpel that was in the times of the Law, it would make the Goſpel to be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than the Law, and the truth is, the denying ſuch a mercy to Beleevers children would be a harder yoke to Beleevers, a greater burden to them than all the ceremonies were to the Jevvs in the times of the Lavv. As ſuppoſe this, if a Beleever ſhould plead thus, Lord, there vvas a time vvhen thou didſt not only receive me into Covenant, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my child too, and give my child the ſeal of the Covenant likevviſe, and there vvas a time that I had ſuch a priviledg, that not only I, but my child vvas in a different condition from the Heathen, the Heathen round about me vvas not in ſuch a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as I vvas in, in regard of my poſterity, and I counted this a great mercy, but Lord, ſince the time I vvas converted, and imbraced Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſince the time that Jeſus Chriſt is come, as ſuppoſe a Jevv ſhould ſpeak thus, one that vvas a Jevv before Chriſts time, and ſhould live til Chriſt came, and ſhould plead thus, Lord, haſt thou brought a greater burden on me ſince Chriſt came than I had before Chriſt came, for before Chriſt came I had ſuch a liberty that vvas as dear to me as my life, that I vvould not be vvithout for all the vvorld, that I ſhould not only have my ſelf, but my
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:168534:130"/> child ſeparated from the world, and be in covenant with thee, and under the Seal of thy Grace, but Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince Chriſts coming into the world and ſince I imbraced religion, though I may come and take the ſeales, though I may be in covenant with thee, yet now my child may not, there is no difference between my child and the child of a heathen, Lord is there no difference between this and the times of the Law? thou ſayeſt, thy yoke is eaſy, and thy burden is light, but here is a great burden upon me, that I have not that benefit that heretofore I had, certainly, my brethren, Chriſt did not come into the world to leſſen the Grace of God: you will ſay, they were in a worſe condition then this, but how are they in a better? as for the covenant of Grace in Jeſus Chriſt, that certainly a Jew had, they were ſaved by the ſame way that we are, namely by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving in Jeſus Chriſt, now thoſe that were belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and did underſtand Jeſus Chriſt, they had the ſame benefit by Jeſus Chriſt that we have, I but if their children now ſhould not have the ſame benefit that they had, I ſay then Chriſt hath brought a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yoke upon beleevers in the times of the Goſpel, then was upon beleevers in the times of the Law, and this is contrary to what Chriſt ſaith, my Yoke is eaſy, and my Burden light. Methinks, I wonder that any men that are Beleevers, that have children of their own, that ſhould drinke in that opinion; for certainly, it cannot but be a greater Yoke upon them, and if they ſhould think there were no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between their children and the children of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, they ſhould count it a great Yoke, and they ſhould think it better for them if they had lived in the times of the Law, and before Chriſt came into the world, for then they had benefit for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Now we are delivered from the Yoke of the ceremonial Law that required hard things, and we
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:168534:130"/> are not brought into a worſe condition, you cannot be in a worſe condition ſaith Chriſt in coming unto me then you were in the times of the Law.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially the Morral law, that was a great burden, a great yoke, as looked upon in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works: now for that I ſhal not need to ſpeak much, becauſe I have opened it in the invitation of Chriſt, <hi>Come unto me, al ye that are weary and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy laden,</hi> and there I ſhewed unto you the burden of the Law, and from that, ſaith Chriſt, I will give you reſt. I ſhewed how Chriſt delivers from the burden of the Law, Certainly, the Goſpel then is a great eaſe, to mention to you but two or three particulars in this, then I ſhewd you there how it required abſolute, impoſſible things, impoſſible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us now, not unpoſſible unto <hi>Adam,</hi> n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now it requires abſolute perfection in every thing, it doth not admit of any repentance, no nor of any endeavour, not to accept of it, the Law accepts of no endeavour, except he continue in every thing, he accepts of no repentance. But now, ſaith Chriſt, my yoke is eaſy, I require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of you but what is eaſy, the Law doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of endeavour, but I will accept of endeavour, if there be a will I will accept of it, if there be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance I will accept of it, the Law would not do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So you cannot do what you would, but you muſt do what the Devil would have you to do, ſin is a ſlavery to the Devil.

               <p>And then to name one thing more, the yoke of Chriſt is eaſier then the yoke of Antichriſt, for ſo Chriſt ſpeaks not only for what is for the preſent, but what is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and this ſcripture is an exhortation to us now, aſwell as to the Diſciples in Chriſts Time, now, ſaith Chriſt, it is eaſyer then the yoke of Antichriſt, he ſaith ſo to you, now ſuppoſe Chriſt were here in this time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and ſhould ſay, take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is eaſy, and my burden light; you have heard ſomwhat of the yoke of Antichriſt, my yoke is eaſier, you will ſay, what is the yoke of Antichriſt?

               <p>Firſt. Take my yoke upon you, and I require you to be under no kind of government, but what you ſhal appoint your own officers, Antichriſt he will appoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> officers; but Chriſt he allows you to chuſe your own officers.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, No law that you ſhal be under for your ſpiritual eſtate, as a Church, that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly eccleſiaſtical and ſpiritual, no law but what I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point in my word, I will not give liberty to men to make what laws they will make, no law enjoyned for your ſpiritual eſtate but what I appoint: if there be a company of men and women that meet in a congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:168534:133"/> and meet not only as Chriſtians, but as men and women, there is ſomwhat common to them as men and women, and there indeed the lawes of men may take hold of them, in thoſe actions that are but humane and civill, but now in thoſe things that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly eccleſiaſtial and ſpiritual, that concerns the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man, ſuch things as I muſt expect for ſpiritual efficacy upon my Soul, to work upon my heart, to draw me to God, or to bring God to me, in theſe things I am under no law but the law of Jeſus Chriſt, no men in the world have power, no not Church officers, nor civil officers, neither Magiſtrates, nor Miniſters, have any power to put any Law upon a church in regard of the ſpiritual eſtate of it, in regard of any ſpiritual ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but ſuch as are in the word of God. Chriſt is the great Law-giver, and hath made them already, and and they are to look that thoſe Lawes be kept, but they are to make no new ones, there is no new act, no new Statute, for the ordering of men in their ſpiritual eſtate. Thoſe things that are properly ſpiritual, to work upon the inward man, that concernes the worſhip of God, to draw their hearts to Chriſt, or Chriſt to them, to work upon their hearts, there can be no new act, no new Law made by Magiſtrates, or any church officers in the world, but only ſuch as you find in the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now this is a great eaſe to a Chriſtian, to think, Lord thou tendereſt my Soul ſo much, that none can command any thing but what thou haſt ſet down in the word, and what thou haſt commanded: indeed Lawyers are to ſhew men the Lawes of the ſtate, and Miniſters are bound to ſhew the people if there be any Law, and to teach it the church, but there is no law that Miniſters are bound to open but only the commands of Jeſus Chriſt, they may be made uſe of as men, as publick men, and as opportunity ſerves be helpful in the civil State, but as Miniſters, they have nothing to do but to open the
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:168534:133"/> Laws of Jeſus Chriſt: and this is a great eaſe, whereas this is the bondage of Antichriſt, he will make laws to bind conſcience, and ſo though a man ſhould keep all Gods laws, yet he may be damned to eternity by breaking his laws, and therefore he makes it a bondage in this regard, that a man ſhould be not only in danger of eternal damnation by diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Chriſts laws, but a thouſand laws that he never knows. And that is the ſecond eaſe of the yoke of Chriſt, that there ſhall be no Laws to govern the Church but the laws of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: The difference between the yoke of Antichriſt, and the yoke of Chriſt is this: Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt requires ſubmiſſion to his laws by violence &amp; compulſion, and you muſt do them whether you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them or not, you muſt underſtand them by a Priſon elſe, that which ſhal befal you is impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and baniſhment, by inflicting corporal puniſhment upon you, he wil force you that way to come to beleeve, if you cannot come to beleeve this to be a truth, that is the way to make you to beleeve it, impriſonment, and baniſhment, and mulcts upon your eſtate, and corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon your bodies; but Chriſt takes no ſuch courſe, and gives no ſuch commiſſion, to inforce to beleeve things by ſuch a way as this, but his waies are gentle, &amp; meek waies, ſaith he, come unto me, &amp; learn of me, for I am meek &amp; lowly, &amp; take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is eaſie; and it is eaſie in this, that what I require of you to beleeve, I do not uſe violent and compulſive waies and means to bring you to beleeve, No, but the way that I would have my people uſe, it is inſtruction and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is the ſhewing of them the truth, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Objections that they have againſt this way, it is gently to lead them, and not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:168534:134"/> of them to beleeve, that if a man cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve ſuch a truth they ſhall be compelled to it, certainly, to uſe violence and to compel ſuch a man, is not the way of Jeſus Chriſt. Indeed for ſome outward waies to be uſed to keep men from doing hurt to others, that is another thing, from doing that which may do miſchief to another man: But for a violent compelling of a man, meerly to alter his judgment, though he will keep it to himſelf, and live quietly, yet to compel him to ſubſcribe to ſuch Articles that he cannot ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it unto, certainly, Chriſt would not have any ſuch yoke, to have a compulſory way, to make men beleeve that which hey cannot ſee any reaſon for, but Chriſt would firſt have the ſoul be convinced of the thing before he beleeves it, and it is a mighty eaſe, if we did underſtand it, we would think it to be worth al the trouble we have been under ſince theſe wars be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gan, to be delivered from what the Prelatical, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian men did determin, that they would put upon all thoſe that ſhould have any office or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe any Gift in the Church of God, they would force them, either to beleeve what they ſay to be true, or otherwiſe not to live among them, yea, all people were brought unto it, though they did not underſtand it. As thus, many people were brought under this bondage, Suppoſe any of you were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by a Parator in their Court, well, when you were once complained of, if you had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, then preſently excommunicated if they had got any advantage over you, wel, if once they got you under the cenſure of their Court, you could not get off for your lives without taking an Oath, and in that Oath you muſt acknowledg ſuch things, as I dare ſay not one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in five hundred under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what it was, and yet you muſt acknowledg ſubjection to them; Now what an intolerable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:168534:134"/> was this? and if you did not, you were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for your outward eſtates, they would force it by violence, ſaith Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſt, my yoke is otherwiſe, Oh, what a bondage were we in, and yet not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it? and did we underſtand it, we would not ſo murmur and complain of ſome trouble that we meet withal, and we would cry to God that we might never come under ſuch a bondage again, in ſuch a violent way, to be forced to ſuch an Oath, and to beleeve ſuch and ſuch things to be true, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we lived quietly and peaceably, yet not to be ſuffered ſo to live, except we would change our judgments, certainly, this is an intollerable burden. And would you know what is Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm, and what not? It is in this, that herein the Yoke of Antichriſt is an Iron Yoke, that it will have a violent, Baſe, Forced beliefe, and forced alteration of a mans ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, you muſt beleeve this to be true, and he ſay, I but I do not beleeve it to be true, no, then you muſt be made to beleeve it by impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and Baniſhment, and confiſcation of your goods, and the like, Oh what a bondage is this? And this is the bondage of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>And then there is another thing in the yoke of Antichriſt, and that is not to accept of repentance, of any general repentance and mourning, except
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:168534:135"/> there be a reforming of the particular thing wherein they judg men to be amiſs, which is contrary to the yoke of Chriſt. Saith Chriſt, you muſt do what you are convinced of to be true, what you ſee to be my will, but now, becauſe of your weakneſs, you cannot perhaps underſtand it to be my will, this is your ſin, wel but I wil accept of a general repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that if I ſee your Heart upright, and ſincere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you mourne, not only for your ſins of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, but ſins of ignorance, although you ſhould die and reforme none of this all your life, I will pardon and accept you. But now mark how the yoke of Antichriſt is, Antichriſt requires ſuch things to be done, Well, but I cannot do them, I cannot ſee Reaſon why I ſhould do them, Well, he will never remit no puniſhment, he will inflict puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and never remit any til you revoke your judgment; you may ſay, well, though I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve I will live quietly, and wait, and uſe all the means I can to convince me that this is the right way, and if I cannot, I will live quietly with you, that will not ſerve the turne, Nay, but if you do not ſee it, you muſt lie under this puniſhment til you come to revoke your Error, and profeſs and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the contrary, Thus Antichriſt layes more weight upon his lawes, then Chriſt doth upon his, for Chriſt ſaith thus, there is ſuch a Law I require of you, it is true, if you do not do it, or underſtand it, it is your ſin, but becauſe of your weakneſs I wil accept of a general repentance, you repent of all the ſins you do know, there you repent in general for ſins of ignorance, and though you ſhould not reforme all your daies, I will accept of it, but now when you come to their Court, there would be no help for you, except you promiſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thing that you did before, you muſt come and reforme, and amend, and do the thing that before
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:168534:135"/> you did not do, or elſe never be abſolved by them, but Chriſt will abſolve you, though you ſhould never come to do the thing that he would have you to do, if there be a willingneſs of heart to inquire into his mind, and a willingneſs to do ſo farr as you know. Now what a deal of difference is here? Though you do not reforme the outward action, yet if your heart be upright, I will pardon your offences, come to me, ſaith Chriſt, for my Yoke is eaſier then the yoke of the Law, then the Yoke of ſin, and then the yoke of Antichriſt, Oh how juſt were it for us to be brought under the Yoke of Antichriſt indeed, that are not willing to be brought under the Yoke of Jeſus Chriſt, it is a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indeed, that we are under the Yoke of ſin, when we are not willing to be under the yoke of Chriſt. In <hi>Exodus,</hi> 12: 25: You ſhall read there of the Paſſover, which was to put them in mind of the bondage that they were in ſpiritually, it was to put them in mind to bleſs God for the deliverance from that bondage now, <hi>Saith the Lord there, It ſhal come to paſs, when ye be come to the Land which the Lord wil give you according as he hath promiſed, that he ſhal keep this Service.</hi> Now the word that is Tranſlated Service, it is the ſame word in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal that is uſed when they were in Service under <hi>Pharoa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Exodus, 14. They made their lives bitter in al manner of Service.</hi> Now when they were delivered, ſaith God you ſhall keep this Service<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if the Lord ſhould ſay. Oh, this is a great deal better Service, then the Service you were in under <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aroah,</hi> you ſhall keep this Service. Oh, if you did but think of the difference between the Service of Antichriſt, and the Service of Chriſt, it would be a very ſtrong motive to perſwade us to this Service rather then the former. And ſo the Scripture you ſhal find comparing the Service of ſin,
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:168534:136"/> and the Service of Chriſt together, it is ſaid of ſin, that the ſervice of ſin it is a hard ſervice, ſin hath a great deal of hardneſs in it. In <hi>Prov. 13. 15. The way of tranſgreſſors is hard,</hi> That you may annex to the former, about the way of Antichriſt, and yet it is ſtrange to think, how men had rather be under any yoke then the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, in 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 20. Ye ſuffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devoure you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himſelf, if a man ſmite you on the Face,</hi> If the falſe teachers did any thing againſt you, whatever they did to you, you ſuffered it, though they would exalt themſelves over you, bring you to bondage, make themſelves Lords of your faith, you would ſuffer them, but you will not ſuffer me; and this is uſual with men, to ſuffer any kind of bondage from falſ teachers, rather then from the miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, men will complain of any Service under Jeſus Chriſt, rather then they wil be under the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt. If you were under a great bondage in the Prelatical Courts you cannot but know that if a miniſter would be a ſlave to the Biſhop, he might inſlave all his parriſh: As now, any people in the country, if he would be gracious with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, he would bring any gentleman into ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to attend upon him as he pleaſed, and yet how willing are many rather to be under that bondage, then any other whatſoever, and men are loath for to come under this, though we ſhew it to be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical out of Scripture, this ſhewes the perverſneſs of mens ſpirits.</p>

I beſeech you, let not what we ſpeak unto you, be an aggravation of your ſin, the Reaſon why I have been ſo long upon this Text was, to take away the ſtumbling blocks that men laid in the waies of Chriſt, and to draw your hearts to the Love of the waies of Jeſus Chriſt, But now, if you ſhould reject the waies of Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue under the yoke and bondage of ſin after all, this will be the fruit of the Sermons that they will be called over again at the day of judgment, to make your yoke and burden heavier when you are

                  <p>Thirdly, If the Yoke of Chriſt be thus eaſie, and his Burden light, then you that are the people of God, that are come under this yoke, and have felt the eaſineſs of this yoke, bleſs the Lord for it, and bleſs your ſelves for what eaſe you find in the waies of Jeſus Chriſt. Think but thus with your ſelfe, there are others indeed, they have a ſtrange conceit of the waies of Jeſus Chriſt, and think them hard, and indeed, if their natures be not changed, they wil be hard unto them, but bleſſed be God I find them otherwiſe, when I began to turn my face to Jeſus Chriſt, my Father or Mother called me Fool, and ſaid, you will have no comfort, and my Uncle and kindred, they told me that my comfort would all be gone, but bleſſed be God I did not harken to them, but I find them otherwiſe, I do not find that theſe things bring me into any ſuch bondage, but bleſſed be God I never had that comfort that now I have, Nay, I have that ſweetneſs eaſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that I cannot but think, that if al the men in the world did ſeek now and feel that comfort that I feel, they would be in Love with the waies of God. I hope there are many that can think with themſelves, did but all my kindred, and my friends, Yea, did but all the world feel that ſweetneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eaſe, and comfort, that I feel in the waies of Chriſt, they would be in love with them. If you can ſpeak ſo, Oh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bleſſed be God for this eaſie yoke of Chriſt. There might have been required a hard yoke, if Chriſt ſhould ſay, Well, I endured a hard yoke for you, I came from the Boſome of my Father, and came under the curſe of the Law for you, and if you
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:168534:138"/> will be delivered, you muſt have a heavy yoke upon you too, if Chriſt ſhould have required, that we ſhould have been tied unto a Stake, and endured the fire and have been held unto it, and ſaved at laſt, yet we had cauſe to fal down and bleſs God for ever for this: but Chriſt requires no ſuch thing, Chriſt reveals not only Salvation at laſt, but he reveals a fair way, he paves our way with Gold, ſo that we go through <hi>Canaan</hi> unto <hi>Canaan,</hi> not through the wilderneſs. It is true, before we came under the yoke of Chriſt fully, there was ſome trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but take it in reſpect of the inward man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, their way to a Heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> is through <hi>Canaan,</hi> here in this world they have a <hi>Canaan</hi> that flows with Milk and Honey. It is true, the Jews were in a ſervile way, and God would not bring them into <hi>Canaan</hi> but through the Wilderneſs, and it is true, in outward view there is a great deal of trouble to come to you but in regard of the inward man, there is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Canaan</hi> to bring us to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Saints they may ſuck Milk and Honey con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, if they do not hinder themſelves all the way they are going to the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> the Lord hath appointed them to ſuck ſweetneſs and honey out of the Promiſe of the Goſpel all the way they go: while the wicked have nothing but Swill and Dogs meat, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And here is the difference between a Godly man, and a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, an ungodly man or woman is appointed for execution, and he lives upon the basket, in the mean time, he hath nothing to maintain him, as a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he lives upon the basket, this is his life in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of a Godly mans life, he is going on to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution even in this world: now between the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Prince that is, and what the Saints have in this world, there is this difference, the one is appointed to execution, and lives upon the basket to maintain

                  <p>Again if the waies of Chriſt be ſo eaſie, certainly, Jeſus Chriſt will expect a great deal of ſervice from you becauſe he gives you much eaſe, a man that walkes at liberty, he may walk apace, a Porter that hath a great burden upon him, whilſt that that burden is upon him he cannot go ſo faſt, if one ſhould come and ſay to him Why do not you go fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? he would anſwer, if you had ſuch a burden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> have; you would go as ſoftly as I do. A cart that hath a great load upon it, cannot go apace, ſo here hath Jeſus Chriſt laid no weight upon you in his waies, then let us run the waies of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Beleevers in the time of the Law, they had Shackles, they had a weight, a burden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and therefore no marvel we do not read of ſo much holineſs, and ſpiritualneſs, in the waies of the Godly in the times of the Law generally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, I ſay their yoke was heavy, and therefore they did drive very ſlowly on, but now, when Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is come into the world, and hath
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:168534:140"/> taken our yoke from us, certainly, Chriſt expects that we ſhould now go on freely in his waies, and abound in the work of the Lord, and do more than they did in the times of the Law. Read the Book of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and ſee the ſweetneſs of <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit, had <hi>David</hi> had the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> and had known all of Chriſt, and heard ſo much of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel opened to him, How would he have ſaid, O! how ſweet is thy Law? and if his heart was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, he could run the waies of Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I but <hi>David,</hi> he was under the burden of the ceremoniall Law, for it is not that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Goſpel, certainly, he had not the knowledg of the Goſpel, the things revealed there, though he had a more then ordinary meaſure of knowledg, and if he walked ſo freely, and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the waies of Chriſt, certainly, we ſhould do much more Service for the Lord, now the yoke is taken from us, as the ceremonial Law in reſpect of charge, we are freed from a great deal of charge that they were at, therefore we ſhould be more free when God requires it of us. And they ſpent ſo much time in outward things, in meer outward things, then ſhall we grudge god our time in ſpiritual communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or grudg God time in our Families, a quarter of an hour to Worſhip God in our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Families morning and evening? In the Lavv, they ſpent abundance of time in the Service of God, it may be you think it much to riſe and come to hear the Word, they vvere fain to go long journies to Worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> vvherever they lived in the country, to go to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to worſhip, and yet their worſhip was but an external thing, and in the greater part but bodily labor, when they went thus to worſhip, they had not the Myſteries of the Goſpel opened to them as you have to recompence your labor, therefore I ſay, be more abundant in the ſervice of God. We have
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:168534:140"/> a notable Scripture for this, in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. of the ſtate of the Church, when once they had eaſe and reſt, marke what came of it: <hi>Then had the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reſt throughout all</hi> Judea <hi>and</hi> Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</hi> Here is the fruit of their reſt. The eaſe of a ſecure heart, is that that makes it more barren in Gods waies, but now the Church had reſt through all <hi>Judea,</hi> What then? then they walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghoſt, and were multiplied; and doth God give reſt unto your Soul, and peace to you? then walk in the fear of the Lord, and be edified, and built up more and more, and multiply the ſervice of God more and more, there is a promiſe, that the people of God ſhould be fat and well-liking in the times of the Goſpel, and flouriſh in the Courts of the Lord. There is two things that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Fatneſs, the one is much Feeding, the other is a great deal of reſt and eaſe, when men feed much, and then have a great deal of eaſe, this cauſeth fatneſs, if there be either want of food, or if there be never ſo much food, yet if a great deal of labor, it keeps them from fatneſs; but when there is eaſe, and food, that cauſeth bodily fatneſs. Now Chriſt expects in the times of the Goſpel, that all Chriſtians ſhould be fat, and well liking, that they ſhould not be lean in their ſouls, Why? for, 1. They have as plentifull food as ever was ſince the world began, never had they better diet and more ful diet, and wholſome diet than now. And 2. He hath revealed likewiſe the bleſſed eaſe of the Goſpel, there was never a time wherein the Myſtery of the Goſpel was ſo much revealed to make the waies of Chriſt ſo eaſie as now; there is a revealing indeed of the waies of the Goſpel to be eaſie ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="746" facs="tcp:168534:141"/> and looſe, but wo to thoſe that are thus at eaſe, but I ſay, there is a revealing of the Goſpel and the waies of Chriſt to be eaſie ſpiritually. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, formerly many went to Heaven more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier than we, not only in reſpect of ſuffering, but in reſpect of horror of ſin, the ſpirit of bondage, there were ſcarce any brought to Jeſus Chriſt, but were brought with abundance of horror, and had much of the ſpirit of bondage upon them, and God did recompence them afterwards abundantly, and we find this, that it is true, that many true Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtians, never knew ſo much horror of conſcience, and are very holy and ſpiritual, and have eaſe in their coming to, and living with Chriſt, but we find many very looſe and vain that never had the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin, if God would humble them for their ſins more, and make them ſenſible of ſin, they would not be ſo frothy and carnal as they are. Wel, but though ſome do abuſe the free Grace of God in Chriſt, yet others do not, now you that have ſo much eaſe in the waies of Chriſt, and alſo have ſo much food, ſurely Chriſt expects you ſhould be fat and wel-liking, and that you ſhould do much ſervice for him.</p>

                  <p>And another Uſe is this. If Chriſt accounts his waies eaſie, let not men make them hard, take heed how you make the waies of Chriſt harder than Chriſt makes them, though it is true, you cannot make them hard, I but, you do what you can to make them hard, as thus; you have an Apprentice, or a Child, or a Friend, or a Kinſman, that is looking after the waies of Chriſt, Do not you do what you can to make the waies Chriſt hard to them? you ſcorn at them, and ſcoff at them, and rail at them.
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:168534:141"/> and ſmite them, and take all advantage you can againſt them, you do what you can to vex their ſpirits, and to make Chriſts waies hard to them. Saith Chriſt, I came into the world to that end to bring ſouls to me, to carry them on comfortably to Heaven, but here is a Wretch, ſo ſoon as any one looks towards Heaven, he doth what he can to make his life uncomfortable, a child that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected before, and lived ſweetly with you before, now you do what you can to make them live worſe lives than formerly they lived, and ſo the Wife of your boſom, or your Huſband, and the like; and thus you do what you can to draw them off from the waies of Chriſt, and if they would come off from thoſe waies, then you would do what you can to make their lives more comfortable, O! Wrerch, Wretch that thou art to croſs the waies of Chriſt, thou doſt in this thing but act the part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, for what doth the Devil? the Devil will make his waies as eaſie as he can, and the waies of Chriſt to be as hard as he can, and that is the reaſon that many young Chriſtians are troubled with more temptations now than before, becauſe the Devil ſees they are getting away from him, and he doth what he can to make their getting away to be as troubleſom as can be. As a Jaylor, when the Jaylor hath a Priſoner, if he be in Priſon he takes no notice, but if he be a plotting how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But now if you have another that comes and tells you, that it is meer envy, that the other puts you off out of ill will, and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if you can be but one in ſuch a family you will live a happy life, you will find ſo much peace, love, and kindneſs, and as fair dealing as ever any ſervant had in any family in the world; Now upon this, if you ſhould be taken off, would it not grieve you? truly, it is thus in the waies of Chriſt, you have had (perhaps) good thoughts of the waies of Chriſt, I but ſome, it may be, hath put it into your head, that you will live but a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy and dumpiſh life in them, but now, you have heard out of the word, that you ſhall live the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable life in the world, and therefore, O! now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to give up your names to God before this night, go into the preſence of God, and there profeſs your ſelves that you wil be his ſervants for ever, and bind your ſelves unto him, ſay, Lord, reveale what thou haſt to enjoyne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You ſhal have many ſay, well, I was a puritan once, and I was wont to be praying and faſting with them, but it was ſuch a burden to me, that it was impoſſible for me to bear it, Oh! thou hadſt a baſe carnal heart, and doſt thou leave the waies of Chriſt upon ſuch grounds? know, that a time ſhal come, that thou ſhalt be caſt off with eternal abhorring, and thoſe that thou ſeekeſt to put off from the waies of God, ſhall riſe up in judgment againſt thee; it is the uſual manner of Apoſtates to put off others from the waies of God, becauſe they leave the waies of Chriſt themſelves, therefore they labor that others may leave them two. As a wicked ſervant, that hath beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf wickedly in a family, and the Maſter and Miſtris put him off, then he railes, and brings up an ill report all he can, upon the Maſter and Miſtris, ſaying, there is no living with them, and if they heare of any inclining to live in the family, they cry out againſt them why? becauſe they are put off? ſo here Apoſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves wickedly, and Chriſt caſts them off as unſavory Salt and Filth, and when they are once out, then they find their ſpirits filld with guilt in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and then they raile againſt the waies of Chriſt, what is the reaſon that the Devil doth ſo much labor to bring off men from God? becauſe he is caſt off him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was once an Angel, and he being caſt off from God himſelf, it troubles him that any ſhould be brought on to the waies of God, but if there be any ſuch here, Oh, that this text might convince them that they ſhould returne againe and ſay, I will returne unto the waies of Chriſt againe, for then it was better with me then it is now.</p>

<pb n="751" facs="tcp:168534:143"/> Godlyneſs, which if you come to hit on right, you may carry on the work of Godlineſs with power, and yet with a great deal of eaſe and ſweetneſs. As you know a workman that is skillful in his trade indeed, and can handle his tools well, and is exerciſed in it, he carries on his work with eaſe, it goes on before him delightfully whereas an unskilful young workman, that cannot tell how to handle his tools, he will keep a bungling and ſtir, and tires himſelf, and doth not carry his work on with eaſe, and doth but a little work, and doth it not wel neither, thoſe Workmen that do their work well, with moſt eaſe, they do the moſt work.

Be ſure that all your obedience be evangelical o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, when you are tendering up any ſervice to God let it be (I ſay) an evangelical ſervice; you will ſay, what is the meaning of an evangelical work, or evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical obedience, or ſervice? certainly, the want of the knowledg of Chriſt, is the chiefe thing that makes the waies of God difficult to Godly people, their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is legal, not evangelical. I have already, in the former part of the invitation of Chriſt, ſhewed much of the difficulty that there is in legal obedience, I will give you but the heads of ſome four or five things for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical obedience, and ſhew what it is, or what eaſe there is in evangelical obedience, in compariſon of the other.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Evangelical obedience, is an obedience that the child tenders up unto the father, when you come to do any work, do not look upon God as a ſevere Judge, paſſing judgment, and condemning of you, But look upon God as a father, and all your obedience to be nothing but the obedience of a child to his father, this wil make it eaſy; it is a greater eaſe for a child to obey his father; when he knows that he is a loving and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:168534:144"/> father, then for a gally ſlave to obey him that hath the power over him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Evangelical obedience, is to know that the Goſpel accepts of uprightneſs, where there is not perfection, many Chriſtians are exceedingly troubled in the duties of religion, and they are very difficult to them, becauſe they think, that God being an infinite, Holy God, he looks for abſolute perfection from them in their duties, and if there be any imperfection in their duties, they think they ſhall not be accepted, but now Evangelical obedience, accepts of uprightneſs, when there is not perfection, if there be uprightneſs this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Evangelical obedience, the Duties of the Goſpel, hath ever a promiſe going along with them, whatever the Goſpel requires, it joyns a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to it, as it is in the body, there is an Artery that goes along together with the Veins in the body, that carries the blood, and the Spirits through the body, we muſt look upon every Duty as having a promiſe joyned to it, and this will make our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience eaſie, evermore joyn promiſes unto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Evangelical obedience, it bears the heart upon the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt, upon Chriſts ſtrength, to look up to him; when we go to Duty, not to be tiring our ſelves, and think to carry it out by main ſtrength of our own, but to look up to him, and bear our ſelves upon Chriſt, upon his ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Evangelical obedience, it is not an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience upon which our eternal life depends, we are not to look upon what we do, as any part of the Covenant of eternal life, as that which our eternal
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:168534:144"/> life depends, not as a covenant of works upon which eternal life depends: but the ſafety of our Souls and eternal life is in another way, and all that which we do is rather in way of thankfulneſs unto God for the mercy that God hath granted to us, and the eternal life that Chriſt hath purchaſed for us already; this is Evangelical obedience, now if our obedience and Duties were after this manner performed, they would be very eaſie, if we would but do thus, this it is to obey evangelically<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If we could come as children to obey our Father, and know, that the uprightneſs of our hearts is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and to look upon every Commandment as having a promiſe annexed to it, and to bear our ſelves upon the ſtrength of Chriſt, and to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Duty only as a teſtimony of our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God for eternal life purchaſed for us, rather then a part of the Covenant of eternal life: Now this obedience hath a great deale of eaſe in it. But becauſe we have ſpoken largely heretofore about the difficulty of the burden of the Law, and of the reſt of the Soul from under it, it ſhal be ſufficient to nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it at this time, but if we would have eaſe in the waies of Chriſt, we muſt performe all our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in an Evangelical way, and I will add this one thing to it.</p>
               <p>As our obedience, ſo our humiliation for want of obedience muſt be evangelical, for many Chriſtians, may find their obedience ſomwhat eaſy to them, I but, when they do not obey, then the ſorrow for their ſin that is grievous, their humiliation that is a burden to their Spirits, ſin lyes upon them as a burden, I but, we ſhould be humbled for our ſins in an evangelical way, as wel as performe duty, in an evangelical way. Now evangelical humiliation, it is a ſorrow for ſin, not that we might purchaſe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:168534:145"/> for that ſorrow, as we muſt not perform a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to think to purchaſe Heaven, neither muſt we ſorrow for ſin to think to ſatisfie for ſin, and to purchaſe pardon for our ſin, but our very ſorrow for ſin muſt have a ſweetneſs from Chriſt in it, it muſt be out of love, our very mourning muſt be a fruit of love, and not come from the fear of being deſtroyed eternally for ſuch ſins, that is legal ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, I have ſinned againſt God, and therefore am afraid that God will deſtroy me eternally, and therefore I am ſorry, No, but I have ſinned againſt the Lord, a gracious, and a merciful Father, and the Lord yet hath made a Covenant with me, that he will not take advantage of my ſin, that he will not deſtroy me, and therefore my ſoul mourns and laments the rather for my ſin, that I have ſinned ſo much againſt the grace of the Goſpel as I have done: Sorrow evangelically, and then your ſorrow wil have more ſweetneſs in it then all the joy that the men of the world have, when all their Corn and Wine and Oyl is encreaſed, not only when God lifts up the light of his countenance, but even the very ſorrow of your heart for ſin may have more ſweetneſs in it, then all the men of the world have, when their Corn and Wine and Oyl encreaſeth. Many Chriſtians have much bitterneſs in their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but certainly, Evangelical ſorow, the tears of it is Roſe water, that hath a great deal of ſweetneſs, it is ſweet both unto God, and ſweet unto the ſoul, even while the ſoul is ſorrowing, there is ſweetneſs in the heart, and this is the difference between legal terror, and Evangelical ſorrow, the one hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bitterneſs and gal in it, and the other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſweetneſs. That is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another way to facilitate and make eaſie that we do is this, Labor to keep our hearts in
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:168534:145"/> a conſtant readineſs and preparation to every duty; Duties are very hard becauſe we fall upon them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared, we are not in a readineſs continually unto every good work, you know when you are ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any work, and if you have many things to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, and to look for, when you ſhould go about your work, it will go off but heavily, and it will be more troubleſom, but now, when every thing is prepared in a readineſs, then how ſoon and how eaſie doth the work go on? when you are going to Sea, there is making a great deal of preparation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand, now when the Ship is rigged and trimmed &amp; every thing ready, then you are at an inſtant able to put off, and ſet ſaii, and go away, when al things are ready, you go off with eaſe. If you would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain Gueſts, if they come upon you ſuddenly, and you have nothing ready, what a deal of ſtir is in the houſe? what running up and down this way and that way, but now, if things be ready when they come, they are entertained with a great deal of delight, and all things in the houſe are in order, and things go off very eaſily, and there is no trouble in it. Truly, thus it ſhould be with a Chriſtian, he ſhould not only perform duties now and then, but his life ſhould be a conſtant walking with God, ſo that he ſhould be alwaies in readineſs for every duty that God requires of him, &amp; ſo it comes to be eaſie. As now for the duty of Prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you ſhould keep your hearts in a praying frame continually, and then prayer would be eaſie, it would be an eaſie thing for you to pour forth your ſouls to God, when you keep your hearts in a praying frame all the day long. It may be when you go to prayer, you find a great deal of trouble within you, your thoughts wander, and your affections are dead and dul, and you riſe up diſcouraged: But what is the reaſon, you do not keep your heart all the day
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:168534:146"/> long in a praying frame, in a heavenly temper and frame in the day time, and therefore when you come to pray at night, there is no readineſs in your hearts to the duty, but you are altogether indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to it. And ſo to come unto the Sacrament, you find it a great labor and toyl to prepare for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as you ſhould, I ſpeak of thoſe that make conſcience of preparation, many times they find it a mighty toyl, a hard work; I, but Chriſtians ſhould keep themſelves alwaies in a Sacramental diſpoſition, a Sacramental frame, alwaies having their ſpirits ſavoring of the meditation of the death of Jeſus Chriſt, that nothing ſhould be more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to a Chriſtians Soul than the meditation of the death of Chriſt, and of diſcerning the Lords Body, and the Covenant of grace, and giving it ſelf like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to God in a Covenant of grace, this ſhould be continually, and then if you ſhould receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament every day, you might be fit for it, or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry week, you would be fit for it. Now People think it a great matter, and make a great deal of do about receiving of it often, whereas the truth is, the Saints of God, they ſhould be in as great a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to receive the Sacrament, as to hear the word, or to pray, and that would be a mighty eaſe unto them, therefore if things were as they ſhould certainly, it would be more convenient to have it more ordinary and conſtant, every Lords day the Sacrament. The Chriſtians in the primitive times would receive it every day in the year, and they kept their heart in readineſs to ſuch kind of duties, let it be what work it wil be. You ſhould be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in affliction, if affliction come upon you and your heart is not in a readineſs to alter your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Oh! it wil be a grievous burden to exerciſe patience, it wil be a hard thing for you; now you ſhould keep your hearts ready for every condition,
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:168534:146"/> that is the true work of grace in the Soul, to keep the ſoul in a conſtant bent Godward and that Soul wil do things very eaſily. Somtimes you have much ado with your children when ſtrangers come, to keep them in good order the reaſon is, you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them at other times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that is the reaſon that they trouble you when ſtrangers come; but keep them in a good order at all times, and then you wil have them right at thoſe times; So it is with the heart, keep the heart prepared and ready to every good work, and then every work wil be eaſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you wil ſay, <hi>That is a great deal of toyl and labor, to keep our hearts alwaies bent, and ready to good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that I anſwer, at firſt it may be ſome labor and toyl, but thoſe that have once got their hearts into a readineſs, find it not ſo hard, but have a great deal of eaſe, As now it is a great deale of toyl for one that neglects his accounts, he is not ready, but his accounts are intangled, if he be called to give a perfect account, it is a great deal of toyl to him, but now let a man get over the difficulty, and make all his accounts cleer, now for him every day to keep his Books ſtreight and cleer, this wil not be ſo great a trouble. This is the difference between one Chriſtian and another for all the world, one that ſhall take his pleaſure all the week long, and ride this way and the other way, and neglects his Books, and but one day in the week will look them over, he wil have a great deal of trouble, and it wil break his head ſomtimes, when he hath multitude of buſineſs. But now the other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, looks into his Books every day, ſpends half an hour, or a quarter of an hour every day, and he goes on with a great deal of cheerfulneſs: So it is
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:168534:147"/> with many Chriſtians, they think on the Lords day they muſt have their hearts in a good frame and temper, but all the week they have no thoughts of God, and of the word, and now when the Sabbath comes, or Sacrament and holy duties come, they are burdenſome to them; whereas another that keeps his heart in a holy frame, he rejoyceth in the Sabbath, for he hath had a Sabbath day frame of heart all the week long. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans life ſhould be a perpetuall Sabbath. And that is the ſecond means to facilitate every good work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another is this, Labor to inflame your hearts with love unto the Duty, Do not do duties becauſe you muſt do them, but uſe all the means that you can for to kindle in you a love unto the duty, never ſatisfie your ſelves with this, I ſee I muſt do duty, Conſcience puts me upon duty, therefore I muſt do it, ſo it may be burdenſom but labor to uſe all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments you can to make you in love with the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A Schollar that is in love with his Book, will not cry when he goes to the School, and eſpecially if he delight in it, and be in love with his Maſter, there is many that are put to go to School, that dare not go, Oh, their Father will be angry, and their Maſter wil be ſevere, if they ſhould not learn, and ſo they learn but with much ado, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do any thing in the world than go to School, neither love their Books, nor love their Maſter, and ſo ſeldom come to any eminence of learning. Love takes away all difficulty, love is aſhamed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of difficulty at any time, as now take a man that loves recreation, that loves that kind of ſport of hunting or hawking, if he love it, he wil be run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the dirt all the day long, though it be a hot day, run over hedg and ditch, whereas now if ſuch a man had not a love to ſuch a thing, but were injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:168534:147"/> to ſuch a thing, that you muſt all the day from morning to night eate not a bit of bread, but all the day long run after doggs over hedg and ditch, and through waters, it would take away the love that ſuch a one ſhould have in his ſports, and what a miſerable bondage would this be? ſo it is in the waies of God, let there be love to the waies of God then whatever difficulty, there may ſeem to be in them, it is taken away preſently, love to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Jeſus Chriſt will take away the difficulty of the waies of Chriſt; you know when <hi>Jacob</hi> loved <hi>Rachel,</hi> he cared not how long he ſerved for her, the hard nights were not hard to him, Love God, and love Chriſt, and then his waies will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another rule is this, do not looſe your incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, that that you have had from what good God doth beſtow upon you, and inable you to do, take heed of looſing that incouragement, many Chriſtians are altogether looking upon what they ought to do, what God requires of them to do, and becauſe they have had not yet attained unto what they ought to do, and what is required of them to do, therefore they find no incouragement from what the Lord hath already beſtowed upon them what the Lord hath already inabled them to do, they wholly neglect that, and never think of it, they think of what they want, and what they ſhould have, and what they ſhould do, and ſo they are labouring to get what they ſhould have, and to do what they ſhould do, but for what God hath ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them to do already, or what God hath given them already, that they do not think of, and for want of thoſe incouragements, they make their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for the getting of more to be burdenſome to them; but now, when we are endeavouring to do
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:168534:148"/> more we ſhould go on in the ſtrength of this incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, Oh, bleſſed be God for any little. You ſhal have Chriſtians thinking of what they ſhould do, and therefore they think all the grace they have is nothing, Oh! ſay they, that which I have done what is it? It is true, if we were looked upon in the way of the Covenant of works it is nothing, but in the way of the Covenant of Grace, it is a great deal: now that wil be a great eaſe to your ſouls, labour to get more, and do more for God, but ſtil carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with you the incouragement of what God hath done for you, when you pray for any grace, bleſs God for any grace you have: Take notice of al the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement that God doth give you, and that will help you to go on in any further work that God calls you unto, and the want of this makes the lives of many Chriſtians to be very greivous and burdenſome unto them, becauſe they neglect thoſe incouragements they might have from what God hath inabled them to do, and from what God hath done already for them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Take heed of lying in the guilt of any ſin, I meane, though in reſpect of God the guilt is taken away from beleevers, but of lying ſo in any ſin, as not to cleer up all between God and your ſoul for the diſcharge of it, of having any thing not cleered up in your own conſciences, take heed of lying in any ſin unrepented of, that is my meaning, every ſin that a man commits, excepting thoſe daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions and infirmities of the Saints, which they cannot while they are here in the fleſh be altogether without, but every other ſin, it is as a thorne, at leaſt a thorn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the foot, every ſin that a man hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by ſtrength of temptation, it is a thorn in the foot, and if it be a greater ſin it is a gaſh in his fleſh.
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:168534:148"/> Now a man that hath a thorn in his foot, he cannot go very faſt, but eſpecially, if he have a gaſh in his fleſh: when thou haſt been overcome with a great ſin, thou haſt given a great gaſh unto thy ſoul, and other ſins, the ſin of thy paſſion, and the ſin of thy giving liberty to thy thoughts, may be as a thorn to thy foot, to make thy way very hard unto thee. No marvel though thou complaineſt the way is hard, it is not the hardneſs of thy path, but the tenderneſs of thy foote that makes thee to think the way hard; therefore let every Chriſtian, if he would go on with eaſe in the waies of religion, as ſoon as ever a thorn is got into the conſcience, Oh! get it out preſently, do not let it lye and fret in the fleſh, Oh! if we would as ſoon as we had committed ſin get it out of the conſcience preſently, then repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance would not be ſo difficult, and you would find your heart at a mighty deal of eaſe. When a man goes with pain, and hee lookes upon his foote, and pulls the thorn out, he goes with eaſe then. As the beaſt, when you go in the way, and your beaſt halts and ſhufflles, you will have him ſearched, if you cannot ſee it your ſelfe, then when you come to the next Smith, you have him ſearched; ſo, do you find the waies of God difficult, that you cannot go the pace you were wont to go, ſearch your hearts ſee whether there be not a ſtone in your hearts, or ſome gravel, ſee if there be any particular ſin that you know to be a ſin, and particularly repent of that, and that will make the way of God eaſy to you, the often renewing of repentance will make the way of God eaſy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Labor by wiſdom to order the duties of your condition, that is thus, Labor for wiſdom to know what is ſuitable to your condition, and order the duties about that condition: many think, Oh! if I
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:168534:149"/> were in ſuch a place as ſuch a one is, I would doe thus and thus, but you ſhould look upon the duties of your preſent condition, what is the condition that I am now in? I am a ſervant, what is my duty in that condition? not what is the duty of a gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And ſo in a ſingle eſtate, what is the duty of this condition? not what is the duty of a marryed Condition, and ſo in a Married Condition, what is the duty of that? And ſo when you are in affliction, what is your duty at that time? or if ſo be that God cal you to humiliation, you ſhould mind the duty of humiliation, And when God calls you to rejoycing you ſhould know the duty of that time. Some when God calls them to rejoycing, they think they muſt be humbled, and when they are called to be humbled, they think they ſhould rejoyce, and when they are called to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, then they wil be poring upon their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and when God calls them to ſearching of their hearts, they have thoughts of matter of joy. Now wiſedom to ſuite our duty to our condition, and to apply our duty to that condition, is a great eaſe to the ſoul. Now many times we are thinking of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at one time, that is not the duty of that time, may be when one is ſick, Oh! they are many times trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that they cannot go to heare the word, and meere with Gods people, and ſpend ſo much time in prayer, and meditation, and reading as they were wont to do, and upon this they trouble themſelves, now this is not the duty of your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the duty of your condition at that time is to fanctify Gods name in your affliction and to quiet your heart under the hand of God and the duty of your condition is not to go to heare ſermons now, but to think of what you have heard heretofore, the duty of your condition now is not to ſpend ſo much time in your cloſet in prayer as when you were in
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:168534:149"/> health, and you are troubled for the want of this, we often trouble our ſelves about thoſe duties that are not the duties of our preſent condition, and that makes them difficult, now wiſdom in ordering our duties wil much help to facilitate them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Another Rule is this, In the performance of duties, you ſhould eaſe your ſelves of the care of the ſucceſs of what you do, about ſucceſs, or diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for want of ſucceſs; nothing makes our lives more troubleſom, and our work more difficult than our carking care about ſucceſs, I wil do this and this, but I am afraid I ſhal not have ſucceſs, or if I have ſucceſs, not ſuch as I deſire, but now, if you would perform duties in a gracious manner, look to the du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty perform that, and caſt the care wholly upon God, it is enough for me to do what is required of me as a creature to do, and let God himſelf take care of that that belongs to him, and that is the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. I told you, in the opening of the eaſe, that there is certain ſucceſs, and yet we might trouble our ſelves in carking about ſucceſs; now if we can go on in performance of duty, and never be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about ſucceſs, it wil be exceeding eaſie, but Chriſtians find ſomtimes that though they have been diligent in performance of duty, yet they do not find ſucceſs, they find nothing comes of it, and this troubles them, &amp; this makes them go heavily to the duty at another time, I but obſerve that whatever duty you perform, if you do not find preſent ſucceſs you muſt not conclude that there wil be no ſucceſs, the carking about the ſucceſs in things, makes the work extraordinary difficult, now if we could bring our hearts to this, Lord, I am where thou wouldſt have me, and doing what thou wouldſt have me, and as for the ſucceſs that belongs not to my work but to thy ſelf, I walk according to that that is thy wil, and as for ſucceſs I will leave that to thy ſelf.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="764" facs="tcp:168534:150"/>8. Another rule is this, do not tye your ſelves to what Chriſt doth not tie you unto; there are many Chriſtians, bring upon themſelves many ſnares that way, by tying themſelves to that which Chriſt doth not tie them to, tying themſelves to ſuch a time of prayer, to ſpend ſo much time in ſuch a duty, we muſt take heed of laying a yoke upon our ſelves, do not put a yoke upon Chriſts yoke. It is a great queſtion to many, and its to me a queſtion, whether in the Goſpel there is required any Vows at all, to vow any thing that is not a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before we have vowed it, indeed to ſtrengthen our ſelves to do what God requires, as <hi>David, I have ſworn to keep thy righteous Laws,</hi> we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage our ſelves that way, but properly in the Law it was a free will Offering, but for a Vow now, I do not find that the Goſpel hath any ſuch thing, for men to bind themſelves to that that they were not bound to before by the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indeed whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we are bound to by the word, that we are to engage our ſelves to the utmoſt, but now to bind our ſelves to any thing elſe, as that we will as long as we live keep ſuch a day, this will prove to be a ſnare to you, God requires it not, it may be that day that you would obſerve for one duty, God may require it for another duty, may be you will keep a day of faſt for ſuch a great deliverance, for ſuch a great mercy, certainly, it may prove a ſnare unto you, God may call you to another duty on that day, to the duty of thankſgiving. Many will vow to keep ſuch a day, and when they have vowed it, they know not how to go back. And ſo many will vow they will do ſo much every morning, and ſo much that day; this may bring a ſnare upon you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to do all what you can for Chriſt all the day long, conſider your duties, and lay the word upon you, but to put upon your ſelves that which Chriſt
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:168534:150"/> puts you not upon, it is that that makes the duties of Religion very tedious, and many have done it that way, not foreſeeing the inconveniences that may come upon it, and yet they dare not go back. Therefore I would rather adviſe Chriſtians, to take heed of ſuch things as thoſe are, but to walk in the way of Chriſt according to that the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires for the preſent, and not to bring themſelves into a ſnare, and ſo they ſhal make the way of God more eaſie.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Another Rule is this, Take all advantages, take all opportunities and advantages, all the gales of Gods Spirit, do not neglect the opportunities you have, the neglect of opportunities may bring us to woful difficulties, As in voyages, if a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe that are watchful for al opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties find the waies of God eaſie. It was the ſpeech of <hi>Alexander,</hi> becauſe he carried things ſo eaſie as he did, &amp; in a little time conquered al the world, when it was asked him, how he could do ſo great things, and carry on things with ſo great eaſe? his anſwer was, by neglecting nothing, he meant, by neglecting no advantage. There are many men, that when God helps them a little, they carry the work on with eaſe, but then they do not follow on their work, and ſo they bring themſelves into ſtreights. As
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:168534:151"/> now we cry out of theſe wars, what a great deal of trouble they put the Nation to, and one main thing is, for want of taking advantages, and following advantages, We ſay ſomtimes, Oh, if ſuch a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had been followed, ſuch a victory that we had at <hi>Brainford,</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and other places we might have delivered our ſelves from abundance of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and tediouſneſs of war; but when God gives advantages and we do not follow them, no marvel that we find trouble: So it is with many Chriſtians, you find many troubles in Religion, Oh, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you do not follow your advantages, if you had ever ſince you were young, and ever ſince God revealed himſelf to you, followed the gale of Gods ſpirit, your old age might have been ſpent in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but gales of joy, comfort, and the like, but now no marvel you act with ſo much difficulty in the waies of God.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Another Rule is this, Preſerve all your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences that you have had of the goodneſs of Gods waies, when your hearts have been moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and you have walked moſt cloſe with God, and God hath come in to your ſoul: Preſerve thoſe experiences, keep them by, that they may help you againſt an il day, it may there be may be a time a coming, that you may be in ſpirituall deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and that may be grievous to you, but if you had kept the experiences you had of God when your heart kept cloſe to God, it would much help you, &amp; ſweeten your hearts, to think of the daies of old. As <hi>David</hi> when he was in deſertion, he would many times be thinking of the daies of old: So if Chriſtians would be very careful to obſerve and lay up all the experiences that they have of God and his waies, the ſweet and good of them, it would mightily facilitate them in holy duties, and be a
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:168534:151"/> continuall Cordial to them, and put ſpirits into them, to make them go on with eaſe in any duty God requires of them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Another Rule is this, Take heed in any duty of diſturbing paſſion, the diſturbance of paſſion puts people ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As Children, that when they cannot have their deſires, fling a way all, this makes every thing hard, but if you could but keep your ſelves in a conſtant quietneſs, you ſhould have every condition and every duty delightful but I have ſpoken of that (you know) of the evil effects of it, and of meekneſs, &amp; the gracious effects of that, but I bring it only now as a rule, that you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent all theſe rules together. As now ſuppoſe a company that are in a Boat, and there cometh a ſtrong wind and toſſeth the Boat, you ſhall have ſome ſilly people, that wil be ſhriking out, and mightily troubled, and through their paſſion will be riſing up in the Boat, and be ready to tumble down all through their paſſionate carriage in the Boat, whereas thoſe that have skil; wil ſit ſtil, and be quiet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and give up themſelves to the ſtream, and that is the beſt way to come with the greateſt eaſe, you make the Boatmans labor ſo much the more d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fficult, by your unquietneſs in the Boat; So cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, you make the work of God more difficult when your hearts are unquiet. Let the thing be what it wil, you wil ſay, Oh, no bodies condition is ſo as mine, Certainly, your unquietneſs will not help you, you wil not come the ſooner to your lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place, if people toſs from one ſide of the Boat to the other, and be unruly in their carriage, they wil not come the ſooner to their landing place, the
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:168534:152"/> quieter they ſit in the Boat, the ſooner they will come to land. So it is in a Chriſtians courſe, he muſt not think to come to have his deſires ſatisfied by his froward carriage, to be angry with God or man, or the means, that they do not work as they would have them, but the quieter they ſit, and give up themſelves to God, the ſooner they come to their deſires.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Another Rule is this, Communion with the Saints, ſpirituall Communion, Heavenly Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, not frothy Communion, but a ſpiritual holy gracious communion with the Saints, wil facilitate the waies of God very much, the experience of this is very much, I do not know how it comes to paſs, but certainly, now there is a great deal leſs commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between Gods people than formerly the times have been, when ſome that have been alone, have bin ſtriving and tugging, and could not get their hearts into any good frame, they have come bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> into the company of Gods people, &amp; laid their experiences together, and warmed themſelves together, and then they have gone away, and they have thought nothing too hard that God ſhould require of them to do or to ſuffer, they would go into their cloſets and pour out their hearts, if there were trouble in the Family, between Wife and Husband, in regard of paſſion, when they have been amongſt Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they could carry themſelves in a gracious manner, Oh! communion, much communion with the Saints of God, it is that that facilitates the waies of Religion. We know in travelling, if a man be travelling a journey all alone eſpecially if he have wind and weather againſt him, his way is tedious to him, very hard and grievous, and he is tired in his journey: but now, if he travel and have good company, and good diſcourſe, and is joyfull,
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:168534:152"/> and cheerful when he is going, his journey is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when he comes to the Inn, he ſaith, I thank God, I am not weary at al, Why is it ſo? the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is long, I but the company is good, the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is good, and that makes it eaſie: So it is in our journey to Heaven, we complain of tediouſneſs in our journy, Why is it? becauſe we love to be alone. As many that are of a dumpiſh diſpoſition, loving alwaies to be alone, there is a time indeed that people ſhould be alone, &amp; they have ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings from God that way, but there is a time to have Society with the Saints, and it is an ordinance appointed by God for the facilitating of Gods waies, while we are paſſing in the wilderneſs in our way to Heaven, and therefore make Conſcience of that, to have Communion with the people of God, to ſpiritualize your Communion, and make what uſe you can of them to help you in your Chriſtian courſe.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Another Rule is this, Exerciſe much Faith, Faith doth facilitate every action as Unbelief makes every thing difficult, let a man be put upon any duty if he have an unbelieving heart, it is difficult, Why? becauſe before he comes to it, he ſaith, I ſhal never go through with it, and therefore comes heavily to it, all the while his unbelief prevails, his work goes heavily on, but let a man come to a work, and come to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, A man of confidence, and of ſpirit, he ſaith, let me take ſuch a thing, another man he is toyling &amp; laboring, and he ſaith, I ſhal never bring it to any thing, but now another man, that is of a lively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, faith he, let me come to it, and he carries it on with eaſe: and the truth is, when Chriſtians ſee Gods call to any work, they ſhould not pore upon the difficulty, but exerciſe Faith, and come
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:168534:153"/> with courage to the duty, and God will carry you through, God that cals me to a work, he will give me ſtrength in the work, and therefore let me go to the work as if I were carried through it already, go on with confidence and reſolution, and take heed of Unbelief, up and be doing, and the Lord wil be with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo do you ſay to your ſouls when you are diſcouraged in the work, Oh, ſuch and ſuch have miſcarried, and how ſhall ſo weak a ſoul as I do? Wel, up and be doing, and the Lord will be with you.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Laſtly, Do not ſatisfie your ſelves that you have grace, but labor to have ſtrength of grace, that is eaſie to a ſtrong man that is hard to a weak, now Chriſtians ſhould not ſatisfie themſelves with Gods grace, God hath begun grace in thee, you will ſay, he that hath the leaſt dram of grace, it will carry him to Heaven, I but it is a great deal of grace that muſt make the waies of Religion eaſie and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to thee: Therefore look into the word, and when thou doſt exerciſe Faith, or make uſe of any Ordinance, Do it for the encreaſe of grace, for ſtrengthening thy ſelf, ſtrengthen thoſe weak things that are in thee, that thou maiſt go on ſteadily in the waies of Religion, and know to that end, that though thou beeſt never ſo weak, yet there is ſtrength enough to be had. Look into the word of God, and you ſhall find there, that there is a moſt glorious ſtrength that is poſſibly to be attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by Chriſtians, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 18, 19. that place that we have often made uſe of, <hi>What is the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greatneſs of his power to us ward which beleeve, according to the working of his mighty power.</hi> Mark this Text, it is not only meant of the greatneſs of Gods power in working Faith in us, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his power toward us who do now beleeve, God doth put forth power, greatneſs of power, and
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:168534:153"/> exceeding greatneſs of mighty power, and the ſame that he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at the right hand of God. Thou mai'ſt come to have by the exerciſe of Faith, the power of God put forth, his almighty power to give thee Faith, ſo now by the exerciſe of Faith, thou mai'ſt have the power of God, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Power the mighty power of God, and the exceeding greatneſs of the mighty power of God, and the ſame that God put forth when he raiſed Chriſt from the dead, &amp; ſet him at the right hand of the Father. Thou ſai'ſt, thou haſt a dead heart, but wil not the power of God that raiſed Chriſt from the dead raiſe thy heart, exerciſe Faith, Lord, I go about ſuch a buſineſs, it is difficult becauſe of the hardneſs of my heart, But Lord, wil not the power that raiſed Chriſt from the Grave, raiſe my dead heart. And ſo, Lord I have a heart ſunk down to the things of the world, I but Lord haſt thou not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to put forth the ſame power into the hearts of thy people, that ſet Jeſus Chriſt at thy right hand? Wil not that power raiſe up my heart to Heaven, and give me an heavenly heart? Now here is ſtrengthening of thy Faith from the word of God, and that ſtrength that the Scripture holds forth, that God himſelf wil put forth into the heart of his people upon the exerciſe of Faith. And ſo in <hi>Epheſ. 3. 16. That he will grant unto you, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Riches of his Glory, to be ſtrengthened with might by his ſpirit in the inner man,</hi> what a heap of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are here! therefore I put you upon this, not to content your ſelves with weak grace, for there is abundance of ſtrength, not only the ſtrength in Chriſt, but the ſtrength that is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the heart by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, it is one thing for Chriſt himſelf to look upon you, as having a fulneſs of all ſtrength in him, and for
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:168534:154"/> Chriſt to come and aſſiſt you. As now a man that hath a weak Child, he may come with his hand and enable the Child to do that which he could not do, but the ſtrength that I ſpeak of now is, as when one that was a Child before is made a ſtrong man, and hath Marrow put into his Bones, and Blood into his Veins; ſo this ſtrength is ſuch a ſtrength, that is the Riches of his Glory, according to the inward man, Mark, Firſt, Here is ſtrength. Secondly, Here is ſtrength in the inward man, ſtrength in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man is not ſo much as the inward man. Thirdly, Here is ſtrengthened with might. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, This ſtrength is by the Spirit, now the Scripture uſeth that word <hi>Spirit</hi> to expreſs ſtrength by. <hi>Their Horſes are not Spirit, but Fleſh.</hi> And then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, It is by the Spirit of God. And then it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Riches of the Spirit of God, ſuch ſtrength and ſuch might, and the Spirit of God in the inward man, ſuch as ſhall ſhew forth the riches of Gods Spirit, and then Laſtly, The riches of his Glory: So that the Saints may come to have in them ſuch ſtrength in the inward man, with ſuch might by the Spirit of God, and according to the riches of God, and the riches of his Glory; you muſt not ſatisfie your ſelves til you find ſuch a work of Gods grace in you, as may manifeſt the riches of the glory of Gods power. Now Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Do you work ſo, as by your ſtrength in the waies of Religion, you do manifeſt the riches of the Glory of Gods power? If you do, then certainly the waies of Religion wil be eaſie to you, And then another Scripture, which is to ſhew you that there is a great deal of ſtrength to be had to enable you to go on, is that in the 1. of the <hi>Colloſſians</hi> and ver. 11. <hi>Strengthened with all might, through his glorious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, unto al patience, and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſs,</hi>
                  <pb n="773" facs="tcp:168534:154"/> here is ſtrengthened with might, ſtrengthened with all might, and this according to Gods power, and according to his glorious power, and unto all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and long ſuffering, with joyfulneſs; mark, when we come to have ſtrength from God, that is, when we come to the hardeſt things, to exerciſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, then we have patience and all patience, and and joyfulneſs, and giving thanks to the Father and nothing but thankfulneſs and joyfulneſs, though our condition be ſuch as needs patience. Now theſe rules being put together, they may make the way of Chriſt eaſy, you may run the waies of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and go leaping to Heaven, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the more eaſy, and the more ſweet they be unto you, the more ſweet will they be to others, and you will bring a better report upon the waies of religion, and make the waies of God amiable and lovely unto others. Wel conſider what hath been ſayed in this text, Many truths you cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that they nearly concerne you, now know, that God will require this text at our hands, this invitation of Chriſt, <hi>come to me al ye that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; heavy laden, &amp; I will give you reſt, take my yoke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you ſhall find reſt unto your ſouls; for my yoke is eaſy and my burden light:</hi> The truth is, the ſame and the very marrow of the Goſpel is in this invitation of Chriſt, and therefore I have laboured, to ſhew you as fully as I could, what the ſpirit of God doth intend in this invitation, and to lay before you all thoſe truths that are here, and have laboured to work them upon your hearts, hoping that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of divers things that have been delivered from this ſcripture, in the invitation of Chriſt, are upon your ſpirits, and ſhall remaine in many of your ſouls, even to the day of Chriſt, ſo that Jeſus Chriſt when he ſhall come again with another invitation
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:168534:155"/> and ſay, come, come ye bleſſed of my father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom prepared for you, I ſay, Chriſt will look upon you, having the impreſſion of this invitation upon your hearts. And certainly, Chriſt when he ſhal come to judgment, when poor ſouls ſhall bring this impreſſion upon their hearts, he wil entertain them with a great deal of cheerfulneſs, and he wil give them another invitation, Chriſt ſaith now, come, come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for my yoke is eaſy, and my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den light, doth this invitation prevaile? hath theſe arguments prevailed with your ſpirits? and do you keep the impreſſion of theſe upon your ſpirits? can you if Jeſus Chriſt were to come to judgment, ſhew the impreſſions of theſe invitations upon your hearts, and ſay Lord, thou haſt invited us, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arguments hath been uſed to draw us unto thee, and our ſpirits are come to thee? and behold now the impreſſions of thoſe truths upon our hearts. Oh! if you ſhal be able at the day of judgment to ſhew the impreſſions of theſe truths upon your hearts, you will be happy, and then you ſhal have the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, come ye bleſſed of my father, that will come fully upon you, the remembrance of the work of this invitation upon you, Oh! how ſweet will it be to you? And for others that ſhall live wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they ſhall come to that day, when Chriſt ſhall invite others unto him, come ye bleſſed of my father when they ſhall remember, that there was a time when we heard a bleſſed ſweet invitation of Chriſt opened to us in the Miniſtry of the word, we heard Chriſt calling, Come, come, and profeſſing that his yoke was eaſy and his burden light, and yet we followed after our luſts, and wicked ſinful luſts and wicked ſinful waies, and now we heare that the Saints that did come upon his invitation, that
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:168534:155"/> they ſhal be bleſſed for ever, but Chriſt will not cal us to him, we would not have his yoke upon us then, and therefore now we muſt be caſt off, and have the iron yoke of the wrath, and vengeance, and curſe of eternal diſpleaſure upon us, Now the Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to take thoſe eaſy yokes of Chriſt upon you for the preſent, rather then Gods eternal wrath and diſpleaſure ſhould come to be your portion hereafter.</p>
